for those of you unfamiliar with the " a series of unfortunate events " books , they detail the absurdly tragic lives of the fictional baudelaire orphans , and their struggles to overcome adversity ( after adversity , after adversity , ad infinitum ) .
hovering in the background of their tragedies and occasional , brief glimpses of happiness , is their distant cousin , the scheming , greedy , conniving , ruthless cousin , the count .
given the concept of the story , this poster fits perfectly , with the orphans , standing together but otherwise alone , in the middle , with the shadow of the count casting gloom upon them .
it is a perfect fit , as is the casting of jim carrey as the count

i absolutely love this product .
my neighbor has four little yippers and my shepard/chow mix was antogonized by the yipping on our side of the fence .
i hung the device on my side of the fence and the noise keeps the neighbors dog from picking " arguments " with my dog .
all barking and fighting has ceased .
all the surrounding neighbor as well as me can get a good nights sleep now

i purchased 3 units and they work well for us .
i have 2 units in children 's bedrooms on ac power and the 3rd in the kitchen on batteries for portability .
the sound is clear and set-up and use is very easy .
the best thing about these units is the vox answer option .
i have this option turned on in the kid 's room and they merely have to answer back when i talk to them first without having to push the " talk " button .
this is very handy when you are talking to a 3 yr. old that does n't quite understand how to use this .
i attached a large , very thin magnet on the back of my kitchen unit and i keep it on my fridge ; but can bring it with me to other parts of the house if necessary .
the only small annoying feature is every time the " talk " button is pressed , a beep occurs .
but the other features outweight that small annoyance for me

i 've always wanted a deep fryer , and finally decided to take the plunge .
after doing quite a bit of research , i decided on this model - picked one up at bed , bath , and beyond with a 20 % coupon .
in my opinion , you generally get what you pay for - so the extra cost vs. competitors was n't a real concern .
i must say , overall , i am quite pleased .
while i am new to frying , i found it extraordinarily easy ( it is pretty hot though , so be careful ) .
only complaint would be that the capacity is a little on the small side , say if you 're cooking entrees for a larger family ( for example , you can really only fit 3 ( maybe 4 ) pieces of chicken at a time ) .
but since the chicken needs to cool down anyway , this was n't such a major issue .
it came out nice , crispy , and golden brown - not too soggy , not too crisp - perfect .
i figure if it can handle the chicken , vegetables and smaller portions will be a piece of cake .
although i 've only fried a couple of batches , i am beyond pleased - but i 'll let you know if i have any problems... great item so far though .

easy to use , easy to clean .
two major requirements for a kitchen appliance for me to be happy .
this thing is easier to clean than my old george foreman grill ( and that to me was a pain in the neck ) .
the only time it can be a little messy is when you change the oil , which i do every 2 to 3 weeks depending on how much i 've used it and what i 've cooked .
if i 'm doing just veggies , i keep the oil .
if i do a meat or seafood , i 'll change the oil right after .
very pleased overall .

i 've been a german knife snob for years .
but this 8-inch chef 's knife by japan 's global is the finest blade i 've ever owned .
period .
maybe it 's not as easy to sharpen as a wustof or a henckel , but then again , it holds its edge ten times longer .
i 've spent ten years and hundreds ( and hundreds and hundreds !
) of dollars collecting german steel .
global is so good that it has me thinking of starting all over again

i have a number of booklites , different vendors , different styles , some ac adapter , some straight battery , cheap to higher prices , and this one is the best , the brightest , the one i will most often use .
it is connected to adapter and kept near computerat all times .
i am careful with such items , do n't expect any problems , most booklites are not meant to be manhandled

i was so thrilled when i unpacked my processor .
it is so high quality and professional in both looks and performance .
it has so many features that i love , especially the triple bowl which allows you to process more than one substance at a time .
the egg beater attachment is excellent also .
i am one happy customer and recommend this processor to all

</review_text>
<review_text>

the kitchenaid kfpw760 is exactly as advertised .
it has three nested work bowls .
the inner , smallest one takes a special blade ( a smaller version of the standard processor blade ) .
it 's perfect for pulverizing/mixing small quantities of things .
pulling the used bowl out leaves the next one ready for use without having to stop and clean something .
the same is true for the next one until you reach the largest , 12 cup bowl .
a number of blades come in a well designed transparent and strong storage box ( finally , a way to keep everything together ) .
the unit even has with a fruit juicer accessory that replaces the bowl .
it 's the kind with the rotating hub ( two hub sizes are included , one for lemons and a larger one for oranges , etc ) .
while it seems to work , it 's not as convenient as a low cost dedicated version such as the black & decker , but what the heck , it 's worth trying .
the motor is quiet and you get a real feeling of professionalism when using it .
at first i was disappointed that there were n't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking about it , you only need the provided on , off and pulse .
would i buy it again ?
absolutely .
would i buy it again from amazon ?
again , absolutely .
the transaction was without difficulty and the shipment actually came earlier than promised

i love this bookcase .
my only problem with it is that the bottom right side slat of wood arrived split ( a bit ) , but it still fit together , so i kept it ( excuse the rhymes , please ) .
it 's amazing that despite being somewhat broken it still holds 60 books , including some big heavy hardcovers , 20 dvds , 3 dvd box sets , 12 videotapes , and a few pictures and knicknacks .
and yet it takes up hardly any space in my tiny bedroom .
best part : the ease with which you can put it together .
i have ms , so being able to put furniture together by myself is a very big deal .
highly recommended

as a tea lover for 30 years , i have to say this electric kettle is the best one in terms of cost-benefit and performance .
i 've used this kettle for more than 1 year and it 's still working perfectly .
it boils water very quickly and keeps warm for a while .

</review_text>
<review_text>

my only reservation is for safety sake , it would probably be better to get the version that is wireless , because when you fill this in the sink you must be very careful not to get the electrical prong that connects to the cord wet .

</review_text>
<review_text>

this kettle is amazing .
it 's simple -- you plug it in and flip the switch ( a light turns on to let you know it 's working ) .
it heats very quickly , &lt ; 5 minutes for a full kettle of boiling water and if you only want a cup or two for tea , it heats in about 3 .
for students in dorms , you can use it for oatmeal , soup , tea .
automatically cuts off after boiling for a minute , so no worries about fire hazards .
great product , i use it every day .

i love using them and when washed in fabric softener they are great .
it is a great deal .
was kind of worried before purchase from reading some of the other reviews but after having had them a week , my whole family loves them .
they are much better than the more expensive famous designer towels that i have .
for people who are complaining about these towels , go price similar items at your local high end department stores

as a mathematician , game theorist , and proud chi omicron chi ( xox , aka " xocks " ) brother , i have always been interested in this the simplest of m,n,k games , i.e .
games in which players alternate placing markers on an m x n board with each player trying to place k of his or her markers in a row .
as every game theorist knows , perfect tic-tac-toe play by both players results in a tie game every time , with neither player achieving victory .
the clever child will figure this out on her own , as i did at an early age , and i lost interest in playing tic-tac-toe before i turned five .
i never lost interest , however , in studying tic-tac-toe and similar games , which began my pursuit of mathematics and game theory , and partly accounts for my joining chi omicron chi as a college freshman .
as part of our initiation , pledges had to play a modified form of tic-tac-toe with vodka-filled shot glasses for markers .
each player had five glasses , and as he placed his marker , he would empty his glass .
the loser would drink the remaining shot glasses .
most of us knew how to play perfect games of tic-tac-toe , so really the point of the game , as with most fraternity games , was to see who could best hold his liquor .
i do remember one unfortunate pledge , bob , who never figured out how to play perfect tic-tac-toe and nearly drank himself into catatonia .
all these thoughts came rushing , so to speak , back to me when i saw the " shot glasses tic-tac-toe " available for so reasonable a price at about a dollar per component .
i have a four-year-old son who has yet to perfect his tic-tac-toe game , so i bought this set to educate him .
we play the same way i did in the xocks fraternity house .
of course i do n't give him pure vodka in his shot glasses ; he only weighs 35 lbs .
as 35 lbs represents approximately a fifth of my own weight , i dilute his vodka in a 1-to-4 dilution with orange juice .
i know what you 're thinking : what happens when he loses and must finish off the remaining shot glasses , including mine ?
i am nothing if not fair , so when he loses , i give him an equivalent amount of diluted vodka to however much pure vodka i have remaining in my shot glasses .
since i , knowing how to play perfect tic-tac-toe , never lose to my son , the reverse problem , my having to drink his remaining shots , never occurs .
my son loses more often than not , and he usually ends up walking into walls , falling down , and later becoming violently sick .
you would think all this negative reinforcement would promote rapid and forceful mastery of tic-tac-toe , but his cognitive development must be lacking .
i can only surmise that the time delay between his losing tic-tac-toe games and the negative effects of alcohol poisoning inhibits his forming the negatively reinforcing connections .
he still loves to play , however , but his game , if anything , seems to be getting worse , almost as if he is trying to lose

this is my third pair of kitchen shears .
the first was $ 10 and lasted a week .
i thought the second pair was just fine until my shun shears arrived .
these cut well and are also very smooth while cutting .
they fit my hand nicely .
i can really feel the difference in quality .
these can perform different functions -- opening bottles , jar opener , nut cracker -- one blade has a curve in it to accomodate bone .
i love that they are dishwasher safe .
i probably would n't have purchashed these if i were not completing a shun set .
but now that i have them , this is what i should have been using all along

the knife is solid and very comfortable in hand , however , when i got it new , the blade is slightly bent .
i expect it to be in almost perfect condition , but it 's not

</review_text>
<review_text>

this knife is well worth the money .
it is not only sharp but it behaves in your hand begging to be tuned loose on meat vegetables , fruit you name it .
honestly , i felt it was too much for me but as i got better accustomed to its heft , i knew it was me that did not possess the skills to wield the tool .
do not doubt yourself , learning to use it is a joy .
treat yourself

i made plenty of pizzas on several types of thin metal baking pans , and the results were consistenly mediocre .
now however , with this pizza stone , i no long find myself ordering pizza for delivery .
1 cup water or beer
2 1/2 cups flour ( maybe a 1/4-cup of whole-wheat flour mixed in )
1 package of dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon butter

knead and let rise twice ( i used to do it by hand , but now i have a bread maker which works perfectly for this purpose on the 'dough ' setting ) .
this makes two pizzas around 14 inches in diameter .
either roll them out with a rolling pin , or press them into shape by hand .
the dough seems to be too elastic to " throw " it into shape - i think it 's a skill that takes a long while to master .
i make pizza sauce with a can of tomato paste , some red wine and/or water , chopped parsley , chopped basil , dried oregano , chopped garlic and chopped onion .
i 've also used pasta sauce ( prego or ragu ) with acceptable results .
i almost always top with mozarella and thinly-sliced mushrooms .
i use parchment baking paper under the pizza .
i slide it on and off the stone this way , without resorting to corn meal .
this works perfectly for me every time .
heat the oven up _hot_ ( 500 degrees ) .
it will only take 5 minutes to bake at this temperature .
when the cheese is beginning to brown around the edges , it is done .
the crust is golden-brown on the bottom , with just a bit of crunch .
if i let the crust rise a bit after preparing the pizza , it will be softer and thicker .
store-bought frozen pizzas are also better when cooked on this stone .
i 'm giving only 4 stars because of the price .
there must be a cheaper alternative to this stone , but i 'm not complaining too much , because i 've thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas it 's produced

</review_text>
<review_text>

i had never used a pizza stone but , thought they might be fun so , i put one on my registry .
i made pizza on the stone using store bought dough and got rave reviews from friends .
would definately reccomend this to a friend !
just remember to let the stone heat thoroughly before using .

i just received my jiffy steamer j-4000 pro-line .
it was missing a funnel which would be no big deal if they had not printed the words " use enclosed funnel " in caps every where .
i sent an email and they said they will send me one ( they seem to have a good customer service ) .
now that we have dispensed with the whining , lets talk about the product itself .
if you need sharp lines on your pants or shirt stick with your iron , this is not for you .
however if you would like to take wrinkles out of your clothes and you do n't want to bother with hanging them in the bathroom while you take a shower or taking them out of the dryer on time , this does do an amazing job .
i have also purchased a jiffy personal hand held steamer that works fairly well and provides adequate amount of steam for most of your needs .
however if you take wrinkles out frequently and have the space go for j-4000 .
you get the wrinkles out faster .
if you have a concern about startup time , you do have some control over that .
i just put enough cold water in there for a few shirts and it started steaming in 4 minutes .
if you put hot water out of the tab and reduce the amount of water you can get even quicker startup time .
or you can put it on standby in the morning before you go to the shower and put it on steam when you are ready to use it .
standby setting uses a thermostat to keeps the water temperature at 90c degrees ( close to boiling ) .
if you can afford it , buy one .
it would make a great re-gift item if you find out that you do n't like it

i absolutely love my kitchenaid mixer .
i like to bake and always use my mixer .
i use it to mix cake batters and knead dough .
cakes come out perfect every time .
the mixer is a necessity for every baker 's kitchen .
it is a durable product and will last a lifetime .
the mixer is well built and well designed .
cleanup is easy too .
just remove the bowl and beater and wash by hand or in the dishwasher .
the mixer comes with one bowl , kneading hook , flat paddle beater and whisk-type beater .
there are also many accessories available for the kitchenaid mixers .
i recommend the kitchenaid mixer for every kitchen .
the more you use it , the more you will love it .

this is a perfect machine for the office .
it takes up very little space,is very simple to use , cleaning is a breeze .
you can fill the water tank so that water is ready when you are for a cup of delicious coffee .
i purchased this coffee maker for my husband 's office and for my wallet .
in his building there is a coffee shop but at $ [ ... ] a cup and time away from the desk 1 half hour per cup this was an expensive habit .
the melitta paid for itself in a few days .

i have used this filter daily for over a year and love it .
at first i tried using it in a " mr. coffee " style machine , but found that my coffee grind was too fine and the water would filter through too slowly and overflow if i made more than 2 cups .
since i make coffee for one or two people usually , and do n't like to leave the coffee on the hot pad , so this was okay for me .
then i switched to single-cup method using a drip filter holder that fits over the cup .
i bought it along with a cup at a starbucks about 3 years ago .
one thing that is great about the swissgold filter is that it cleans so easily .
the first time i rinsed it out i took a paper towel to the inside and it came out clean .
i was very surprised .
( not so with the plastic filter holder .
)

the taste is great , and i have n't purchased coffee filters in 3 years .
once i tried it with a coarse grind coffee in my coffemaker , which i received as a gift , and that worked out okay , too .
currently i am using it with my caffiene free teeccino herbal coffees ( help me keep my blood pressure normal under stress ) , and the filter works very well with those blends .
so i highly recommend it .
it pays for itself if you are looking at it from that aspect .

me being an avid coffee drinker i will have to say if you want a quick cup it does the job .
for the money its cheap and provides a quick cup but you better have good coffee i used the pods and found it to be weak at time and sometimes you need a stronger cup i think more brewing is better .
sometimes was a bit messy water all over the place but maybe im a bull in a china shop would recommend the item i spent more on starbucks in a week

this may sound odd , but this is the first steamer that i have ever had .
so needless to say , i do not have others to compare it to .
however,i find that i use it more than i thought i would !
the unfolded steamer fits perfectly in the pot that i most use for vegies and the like , and when i pull out the sides ( the steaming tray ) it fits nicely up the sides of the pot .
besides your basic steamed vegies , i find that it 's perfect for warming up leftovers like rice , leaving it hot and fluffy .
i like that the handle extends , so you can keep the cover on it while cooking , but you can extend the handle for easier lifting .
and you ca n't beat the price

so i read all your reviews previous to my purchase on this and was skeptical .
there were many reviewers that complained about cracks and problems holding an air-tight seal .
mine work perfectly !
they are invaluable and i 'm glad i bought two of these canisters .
are you people sending the canisters through the dishwasher ?
if so , stop it !
the intense heat will eventually crack anything made of plastic .
do you have an old model vacuum sealer ?
maybe that 's the problem - a performance issue .
i have the newer stainless steel v2860 and you could n't pry that out of my hands !
i would give it 10 stars if there was such a rating .
today , i give this product 5 stars .
like most products - only time will tell how well they will hold out in the long run

at first i thought i would n't be able to decide what to use this for , but right away i remembered that i just bought a six pack of onion rolls and they always seemed to have to be frozen and were just not the same later or went moldy in the fridge , so i vacuum sealed them in this and they were good to the last one with no flavor change at all .
yummy !

at first i was turned off by the bright ( gaudy ) colors .
however , i have learned to appreciate that these knives are color-coded !
they stand out in the knife drawer , and you can always find the one you are looking for .
consequently , the right knife is used to get the job done .
the knives are indestructable and durable .
we have owned ours 4-5 years and they show no unusual wear .
put them into the dishwasher !
we do n't do that with another knife ( regretted it when we have ) , but these can take it .
the knives are well-designed for function , comfortable to handle , strong , & sharp .
we love them and gave sets to our adult kids who always are commenting on how useful they are .
friends that visit and use ours comment favorably on them .
these are n't showy knives for formal dining nor will they impress anyone with your classy style .
however , they do impress everyone who uses them .
and , the price is nice

delighted to have it for my wood floors , tile and area rugs .
works great picking up cat fur and other organic and non-organic detritus that collects .
does require emptying the fur catcher and cleaning the brush regularly - gosh darn !
so much easier to do that than taking a broom or dust mop to the entire house .
also have to set up the virtual walls and carry it upstairs and down , when i want to change areas being cleaned .
again , gosh darn !
ca n't totally eliminate all the work , no matter how much i might like to .
do n't know what was wrong with it initially that it needed to be reconditioned , but its fine now

this dutch oven is a workhorse in my kitchen .
i purchased it pre-seasoned because i 've never had a factory-seasoned piece of cast iron cookware .
bottom line : while the pre-seasoning was a plus , it 's not necessary .
just follow the seasoning instructions that come with all the lodge cookware , and you 'll be fine .
my family has had cast iron for generations , and i wo n't pay the exhorbitant prices for those " upscale , professional " dutch ovens that are all the rage these days .
this lodge oven browns spectacularly , and while the dark interior may not show the developing fond as well as a lighter one , that 's not a problem if one simply uses one 's nose .
we can all tell when enough is enough.. .
i particularly like the spikes on the lid of this oven which are n't present on the more expensive ones .
these spikes allow condensation to fall back only my roasts while they cook and i do n't have to worry about a dry product .
the lid on this oven also fits the 12-inch skillet which i own , and that 's a plus .
it conducts heat well and when i use it camping as an oven , breads and biscuits come out as well as at home .
yes , it 's heavy , but that 's the nature of cast iron , no ? ?
if you want something lighter that comes close to the quality of this lodge piece , be prepared to shell out big bucks

when we got married 7 years ago , we were given a hand mixer of another brand ( sunbeam , i think ) that had seven ( or was it nine ?
) speeds and lots of different attachments ( dough hook , wisk , etc. , none of wich worked well ) .
i have a hard time remembering exact spefications because it died after 6 months , and i had n't even mixed anything heavy with it !
i always mixed most of my flour into things by hand to try to spare the motor ( my mom had burnt through several mixers ) .
so we went to the store , and for $ 30 we could get another cheap brand with many speeds and fancy gadgets ( several brands & models available ) , or we could get this kitchenaid with one set of beaters and three speeds .
i chose this simple kitchaid and have never been sorry .
this little hand mixer takes it all--even stiff cookie dough like roll-out sugar cookies .
and it mixes every last bit of the flour in .
beaters do n't clog , dough mixes up smooth .
i plan on someday getting a bigger kitchenaid , but so far have n't needed it .
if you are on a budget , and need to get the most power for your penny , this is the best purchase you could possibly make

i have owned a lot of crappy toasters and actually have n't gotten another for the past 6 years .
i 've resorted to pan toasting in order to avoid another bad purchase .
finally got tired of so much effort for toast and broke down and got this toaster .
it 's so easy to use and it even defrosts frozen bread and can warm up an already toasted slice without retoasting .
worked amazingly well to heat a cold slice of pizza but i 'm sure braun is cringing if they read this !
i love the little pull out tray , you do n't have to pick up the whole darn thing and hold it over the sink and beat it to death !
the toast comes out very even and perfectly toasted every time .

the braun ht500 is one of the best designed toasters i have ever used .
what i really like... .

1 .
a single long & wide slot , allowing you to toast large or unusually shaped pieces of bread .
i have used it to toast very thick pieces of bread , long hoagee rolls , and those huge hamberger buns that wo n't fit in a standard toaster slot .
2 .
very clean , modern appearance .
looks great sitting on the kitchen counter , whereas many of the other toaster models today look like ugly chrome spaceships from the 1950 's .
personally , i 'm not into that kind of retro look .
3 .
an led light that is clearly visible when the toaster is " on " , allowing you to quickly see the status of your toast from the other side of the room .
4 .
when the toast is done , it pops-up only part way .
this helps keep your toast warm prior to you extracting it .
you then pull the lever up a notch higher and it raises the toast up very high , making it easy to pull-out even very small pieces of bread .
5 .
it toasts evenly .
of course , you would expect this .
but you 'd be surprised how some very expensive toasters i 've used in the past were often poor in this area .
of all those items , the first one is by far the most important .
strangely however , few manufacturers today make a long & wide toaster any longer .
braun is one of the few that does .
that fact combined with the great design is reason for me to give it a hearty recommendation

great blender !
i use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails .
powerful motor purees frozen fruits great ! !
simple--only two speeds .
easy clean-up

i have only used this blender once , but already i love it .
i will update my review if anything changes .
no more cheapo blenders for me !
i have tried oster ( really bad ) , and black and decker from walmart ( a tad better , but it did n't work on frozen fruit and ice ) .
first , with the waring , i made a frozen island oasis mix using ice , and the consistency was amazing .
second , since i 'm single , i absolutely love the small size ( i think it 's like 24 oz or so ) .
third , it 's not really that loud .
i mean no louder than any other blender i 've used .
fourth , there are no cheap plastic parts !
yay !
only high quality parts .
the jar is stainless steel .
if the two top pieces are plastic or polycarbanate ( ?
) , they are of very high quality .
fifth , the blades are built into the stainless steel container , and it 's a snap to clean .
just add a cup of water , a few drops of cleaning liquid , run the blender for 30 seconds or so , rinse , dry and you 're done !
cuts my cleaning time down considerably .
moreover , there 's no unscrewing and cheap plastic round things that always tear .
there is absolutely no way that you would have problems with a leaking jar .
last , i did n't have any problems with a burning smell .
i am sticking with waring products .
my mother has one ( at least 32 years old ) , and it still works

the temperature readings were spot on .
there are multiple ways to display it , hang it from the shelves in your oven , place it on the bottom of your oven .
it 's very stable , does n't fall over , mostly because of it 's 4 inch length .
but... as with all things in the oven , this will become splattered with grease , and harder to read , and you 'll want to wash it....do n't !
any type of cleaning , be it abrasive , or chemical , such as simple green , will erase the temperature markings... and make it useless

this ice cream maker is " great " .
the fact that i can use an industrial motor ( my kitchen aid mixer ) is fantastic .
it is my belief that the ice cream maker itself is as near perfect as you can get , contrary to other reviews .
if you read the description and instructions , you will find that it is not the biggest maker on the market and that it does exactly what it says it will...it makes " great " ice cream .

i love this pan .
as for cooking : this pan does a great job on steaks , burgers , chicken , whatever .
leaves really nice grill marks .
the only thing you will need to do is have a cover or splatter shield for it .
i use a 16 " round cover from a much bigger pan just to avoid some of the little drops of grease spattering out on my range .
this seems to work just find for me .
as for cleaning : i let it cool a little after cooking and pour some water ( no soap !
) into the bottom of the pan while it is just hot enough for the water to boil a little , and using a wooden spatula ( only use wood in this pan ) , i scrape all the fond away ( burnt tasty bits stuck to the pan ) and pour into the sink .
i repeat this once or twice and put the pan back on the heat and wipe it down with a paper towel .
i then use some supermarket brand canola oil spray and lightly coat the inside while the pan is still warm .
takes about 2 minutes to do this .
i store this pan in my oven since it tends to have a light coat of oil on it all the time .
this pan is so well worth the hand cleaning to have especially since i live in an apartment and do n't have access to a grill

the diadem cooking set roughly meets the wmf criteria , though there are slight imperfections on the metal and the top .

i did not find a problem with the balance , as previously mentioned by another reviewer .
the only thing a potential buyer needs to be aware of is , that if they are planning on tossing their food , they had better be strong because this unit is heavy !
other than that , it proves to be very useful for large portions .
it heats quickly , heats evenly , holds the heat and leaves plenty of room to stir .
yes , it does heat evenly and allows the heat to drift up the sides .
the purpose of a stirfry pan is to allow heat to move the sides of the pan to allow food touching the sides of the pan to cook as well .
now keep in mind , there isnt a perfect stirfry pan out on the market if you are cooking on a traditional gas top , flat top or coil range .
true frying ala asian style is done on an open flame !

this is simply the best pan i own .
* if * you follow the directions on how to cook with this pot , you wo n't have a problem with sticking .
it 's easy to use , easy to clean , works for just about everything ( except maybe making pancakes - for which you would want a non-stick griddle ) .
i just love being able to use metal utensils with this pot and not having to worry about scratching it .
love it

le creuset 's grills , woks , and frying pans come with a textured black enamel that needs to be " seasoned " like tradiitonal cast iron .
there are instructions in the product pamphlet as to how to do this .
basically after removing the stickers using a warm water and soap soak and drying the pan , the pan is coated with a thin layer of vegetable oil with a paper towel and heated at medium heat until the oil smokes .
let the pan cool , remove the oil with a paper towel , and repeat two or three times .
a surface " patina " builds up that is quite non-stick .
from now on the pan can be cleaned with a moist towel .
in the case of burned-on food , a brief soak in soapy water works well .
as the pan is used the patina continues to build .
le creuset 's omelete pans do come with silverstone non-stick if you like non-stick .
the textured enamel works well and is stable at higher heats than non-stick coating .
i own a le creuset wok , a square grill pan , and three frying pans with this textured finish and i find that they work fine after being seasoned this way .
i also own a le creuset omlete pan that has a good non-stick coating .
this pan work fine for delicate foods like egg and pancake preparations .
the textured finish pans work well for grilling meats , stir fries , and other hardier preparations .
if you use good non-scratch silicone or nylon tools in your le creuset wares and a small amout of pam or a little oil spread with a paper towel you will have no problems .

this is a super convenient item .
i do n't lock it so messing with the lock is not an issue .
the lock could probably be a little more user friendly .
it stores everything just great .
it keeps the dust off of my cuisinart goodies .
i have another three-blade disc holder too .
that one came with my cuisinart .
this one is a must-have .

</review_text>
<review_text>

i am glad that i finally have a storage unit to hold my sharp cuisinart blades .
i have three little kids and the thought of them getting their little hands on them always had me worried .
the only design flaw is that it can be difficult to open and then lock back into place .
i knew this going into my purchase and decided to take the chance as the flaw was better then not having to worry about my children .
hopefully cuisinart is aware of the design flaw and working to fix it

i got this as a gift from my mother when i moved to my first apartment away from home .
she already had one , and loved it .
i use mine quite frequently , and makes quick work of dicing onions and peppers for philly steaks or burgers .
my brother and father have also since purchased these units .
i have had mine going on 5 years now , not a problem with it .
great value , good gift for cooks for one or two , who do not need a huge unit to chop stuff .

before , i would just mash up our food with a fork .
this is much easier .
i 've had it for three years now and it 's still working great .
i use it for everything , now .
my husband does n't like veggies , and i when i cook i usually put onion , celery , and bell pepper in everything .
now we get the taste of my beloved vegtables , and he does n't have to deal with the chunks .
great product !

heads and tails above my 8 year old hoover wind-tunnel bagged unit .
never did understand the 8 bucks for 3 bags .
hoover should have given the vacuum away due to always having to replace bags every week ( adds up to big bucks quickly ) .
the dyson kicks butt... three times the dirt is picked up every week when compared to hoover bag replacement size of dirt removed .
wish the dyson had self propelled system.. .
the house keeper would n't be so tired after 3 hours ; o ) handy hose and a really well thought out system .
hands down the best unit i 've ever owned .
time will tell if it holds up like the hoover unit did .
wo n't miss the belt replacements ( 2 ) or the bag cost on the hoover .
would i buy another ?
if it holds up like my hoover did... you bet... like i stated before : kicks butt at picking up dog fur- !

i received this tea kettle as a replacement for a nova teakettle ( the former model ) that i purchased in october 2005 .
part of the quality of a product is how the company stands behind it , and breville is excellent in this area .
my former kettle developed a short in the on/off switch .
i notified the company by email , and i received an email response in 3 hours asking some questions and for more detail .
in 3 more hours , i received an email with a fed-x label .
they indicated they wanted to see the product , and they would either repair or replace it .
within a week , i had this new model as a replacement , since they no longer make the nova .
i then received a follow up phone call from breville to make sure i got and liked the new product , which i do .
the warranty period for the new product starts again , so it has a full one year warranty .
i also asked about the switch , since i was concerned that this could be a problem , and they assured me that this is a problem they just do n't have with the applicances .
the customer service rep indicated that in 10 years , he had seen about 6 of the type of problem i had .
it seems that a customer service rep that has worked for a company for 10 years also says something about the company .
the new kettle heats quickly and to a full boil .
it also has the sharp looks where you can use for entertaining .
i am happy with the product , and very happy with the company 's service

this electric water heater feels very solid and well built .
when filled to 1.7 liters , it takes about 6 min 30 seconds to boil .
the kettle automatically shuts off when it boils and makes a nice bell noise when finished .
i thought this would be annoying , but it is not !
also , when switched on , there is a nice white led lighting up the water supply making it easy to read .
my only complaint about this kettle is that it is rather loud ( which is why i only gave it 4 stars ) when it is on .
a few moments after the switch is turned on , it makes this rumbling noise for the entire duration of operation

pyrex is always the best !
this enormous measuring cup is great for melting in the microwave and for a homemade double boiler in any pot .
the lid is a hard plastic top with flexible sides that seal up tight so you can use it to store things in the fridge and to carry things places .
also the cover is safe for both freezer and microwave use ( but not the oven ) and is dishwasher safe in the top rack .
the cover has three pouring choices , a regular pour spout , a slotted spout , and a spout with seven little holes .
an extremely useful item to have in the kitchen

ok , this is obviously not the same as the traditional all clad stockpots , if it was it would be more then triple the price of this one .
it is part of the disk bottom collection , however it is still top quality stainless steel and very well made .
i certainly would not consider it secondary .
it is a little lighter in weight than the traditional all clad but it is not a light weight pot by any means .
it is great for sauce , soup , stew , etc .
you will love it and you ca n't beat the price .
it is very easy to clean .
a +
keep an eye out , there is always some kind of rebate or gift with most cooking purchases both on amazon and in department and cooking stores .
i actually got this stock pot free when i purchased my all-clad roti pan set which also came with a rack and turkey lifters in filene 's .
i would have bought it anyway , it is an excellent stockpot and the price ca n't be beat .
tip : if you should get something stuck to the stainless steel use a product called " bar keepers friend " to clean it .
most supermarkets have it and kitchen etc .
and bed , bath and beyond carry it too .
the container ( like a comet can ) is gold with blue and white writing .
all clad recommends it for cleaning stainless steel and it works like a dream and is very inexpensive .

this grater has quickly become the favorite in my kitchen .
it 's very solidly built , unlike the old ones i have , and the non-skid base is pure genius .
the grating surface is nice and sharp .
i love the container that catches whatever you 've grated and then stores any extras with an airtight lid .
although the container faithfully catches the grated material , there will be some spillage - from the outside of the grater - especially with cheese .
one caveat : since the container stores upside down inside the grater when not in use , you have to remember to remove it and flip it over before grating .
yup , i realized this the hard way , and boy was it a mess !
despite this , i highly recommend this kitchen essential

had i known what a difference this would make with my cooking , i would have bought one a long time ago .
everything is faster , now , and everything i mix , from potatoes to icing , comes out smoother , too .
there are a variety of things you can make with this mixer , and i use mine a lot .
perhaps not every single day , but almost .
i bake bread with it every few days , and i decorate cakes for parties and special occasions on the side .
my mixer has never let me down .
in fact , i am buying an extra bowl just for convenience , too .
sometimes you do get a strange smell when you use it to whip something up .
they even tell you in your mixer 's manual to expect it and that it is normal .
i 've had mine for almost a year , now , and was waiting until i had it awhile before i reviewed it .
but i have yet to have any problems with it .
it 's cut preparation time more than half for everything i 've made with it .
from cakes to meatloaf and bread .
it 's sturdy and somewhat heavy , which means it 's not going to easily be knocked off your counter .
it does have a slow start to prevent flour from going all over .
however , if you are using a lot of powdered sugar or flour to the point of it being more than half full , you will still want to use the stir speed until it 's a little more settled and moist or you will end up with a mess .
not a big one , but a mess nonetheless .
it comes with a book of recipes , but i 've only used a few .
i 've never had any issues with it handling all the cookie dough and other heavy doughs i 've mixed with it , however .
in fact , i 've made more cookies just since getting this than i did for years before .
it 's just so convenient and easy that i do n't mind .
i mean heavy doughs , too , like monster cookies and peanut butter m&m cookies , etc .
i do n't know what else to say about it .
i do n't think you will be disappointed in this purchase .
i 'm usually someone who does n't like to spend a lot of money , but this was more than worth it , and i will be buying my daughter one someday , too

the kitchenaid professional 5 plus ( kv25g0x ) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere .
we ordered it from amazon , and got the commercial ( km25g0x ) instead .
we did not want that , so contacted customer service .
they said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another km25g0x .
no good , obviously .
then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise .
they said they sometimes substituted similar products .
great .
at this point we gave up , and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer

i have gone through my share of hand mixers .
so far i do n't have any complaints about this hamilton beach model .
it is powerful enough to whip up the potatoes .
it comes with a case that fits right onto the bottom of the mixer that holds the cord and the beaters .
this is wonderful since i no longer have to search through the drawers looking for the beaters .
over all a wonderful mixer for the money if your just looking for a normal household hand mixer

i love this spatula .
when it comes to getting the last bit of dough or sauce out of the bottom of a bowl , it 's perfect .
the soft silicone head easily contours itself to the bottom of the bowl to get every last bit .
it 's also incredibly stick free .
i made fondue last night and after pouring it all into the serving dish , i wiped the cheese off the spoon with a finger , rinsed it , and it was clean !
it is also incredibly heat resistent .
my household has a lot of spatulas with burn marks all along the handle from resting on the side of a pot on the stove .

this grill is awesome !
i ordered it to replace my old grill , which did n't have the removeable plates and was worn down .
the removeable grills make this so easy to clean...maybe takes 5 minutes .
i had looked at a couple of other contact grills from different manufacturers , and though this one was more expensive , i thought it had a better design than some of the others i looked it .
definitely recommended , do n't hesitate to buy this if you 're thinking about it

i bought this item and had it delivered about a month and a half ago .
it arrived in perfect condition with all the items it says it will come with .
it 's very easy to use and extremely easy to clean .
so far i have only cooked whole chickens , chicken pieces , shishkabobs , and sausages .
if i only ever used it to just cook chicken , it 's still a great price .
if you can follow simple instructions , you ca n't go wrong with this

like many homemakers , i generally leave fixture installation to the man of the house .
my husband refused to drill into our metal doors in order to install conventional curtain rods .
i went without curtains over our kitchen doorway for years and always felt that something was missing .
these magnetic curtain rods solved that problem .
the rod holders attach magnetically without screws or bolts .
the holders have never shifted out of place and have not scuffed or scratched my door .
the curtain rods are stable enough to hold heavy canvas curtains .
i installed the set in a moment 's time with very little effort .
my husband was surprised and thrilled that i found a way to hang curtains without marring the metal surface of the door .

i saw this unit on vacation and came home and bought one .
that was several years ago .
finally , our beloved brewstation gave up the ghost and went on to coffeeland in the sky .
so , i promptly bought another one .
morning is just not the same without our brewstation

tried this on my favorite but often dull chefs knife and after 4-6 strokes was very very sharp .
works great as promised .
casing cheap so not sure how long that will last or if it will hamper it 's operation .
compact , stores well , would be great for motor home or other small kitchen .
for $ 29 , makes me wonder what the $ 99 version does that amazon also carries .
knocked a star off for the cheap plastic case

3 swipes and your knife is sharp on both sides of the edge .
the sharpener folds up neatly into a little case the size of a man 's wallet and is easy to store .
the handy house ships immediately..i got my package within 3 days .
i love the knife sharpener , and love the service i received .
thank

i bought this knife sharpener because i was tired of knives that would not cut & the vender i brought it from , the handy house , told me that it worked and i had bought things from her before on her word .
and it works .
my knifes are old & dull .
a few swips through the sharpener blade & i had a brand new knife & the price is also good .

this set of knives is simply incredible - a must for any kitchen , especially a small one or if you just do a lot of quick small tasks .
these things are sharp , and , as standard for henckels , supremely made .

i know that purists do n't like serrated knives , but these are great !
the weight of these knives is perfect--they feel like very expensive utensils .
the chef 's knife is rarely out of my hand , and the block makes the whole set very handy

was thrilled to find pieces to replace ones mistakenly thrown out , rather than have to buy another blender .
the only drawback is the cover is white and my blender is black

seperatly these items become more costly but here they are at a great value and shopping is made easy because this set has it all

this is my first le creuset casserole .
when i first received it , it was smaller than i was expecting .
but after cooking with it couple times , i really fall in love with it !
now i always clean it after using , and have it on my stove top in the kitchen !
it 's so cute and fun

this is probably the most used tool in my kitchen .
the cost of the machine and bag material are more than repaid in food savings .
i like the rolls as opposed to the bags because i can make the size i need without waste .
watch for sales on meat or fish ; buy large quantities at reduced cost , and cut your bags to a portion size , vacuum and seal , and freeze .
i have taken hamburger , steaks , fish , pork , and chicken out of the freezer after being stored for two years or longer , and they are as fresh as the day i put them in

i got this pan set a few years ago .
i love making checkerboard cakes--they are so simple with this set .
you can use boxed mixes , but i find the thicker consistency of the sample recipe makes a more distinct checkerboard design .
my favourite variation is to make blue and pink for baby showers instead of brown and white .
( i make the white cake and just use food colouring ) .

jeez , everyone , yea , they cost a buck each , ok , a buck !
but they can be reused , how often do you go to the dollar store and spend a buck on a totally usless piece of something that breaks as soon as you bring it home , hmmm ?
or you buy a pack of paper plates and they are gone in a couple of weeks ? ?
well , at least these are serving a purpose , and are reusable....i do n't have to scoop anymore , and i have 2 cats , i change it maybe every 3rd day , and it 's not a chore , takes less than a minute , less time than scooping and smelling it as it sits there , and speaking of , i do not smell their poop at all till it 's changed .
so i 'm happy and i think it 's more than worth it !

my old blender went kaput it was a kenmore .
we decided to buy this blender since it also had a small food processor .
the food processor has become our most frequently used tool .
preparing salsa , omlettes , indian food which requires vegetables chopped into small pieces , pancakes and numerous other tasks have become so easy that we make more vegetarian dishes now and they taste better since the pieces are well and evenly chopped .
really enjoyed the blender during the summer months when we made fresh juices etc .
unlike the old kenmore one this one blends much better .
i recommend this to any one who does not want to spend money on an expensive food processor or does not have the counter space in the kitchen for all the apparatus that comes with a big food processor .

this is a jewel .
takes the skin off nice and clean .
just the tool to get rid of those tough skins on a few tomatoes and no more fuzzy peaches .
just bought 6 more for family and friends .

this is a great shredder .
absolutly the best out there .
it is a lousy slicer .
take the bad with the good i guess .
my wife and i shred lots of cheese because pre-shredded cheese has chemicals added that change the taste and chemical properties of the cheese .
this attachment works wonderfully for cheese .
a note on disassembly .
some people have difficulty getting the cone off the plug ( if you own one you know what i 'm talking about ) .
the very easy way to remedy this is to remove the cone from the plug before removing the plug from the machine .
if you follow this one rule you will have very easy setup and take down .



</review_text>
<review_text>

first , the good stuff : this peeler is sharp , requires little effort in peeling away even the toughest skins and seems quite durable .
i like having it , but i 'm also holding on to my cheap little oxo peeler for a couple of reasons : first , the rosle produces very thick peels , which is a bit wasteful .
second , i tend to be a switch hitter in terms of peeling direction and really like having a peeler that can either peel toward me or away from me .
the rosle peels in only one direction and thus sells both a right-handed and left-handed peeler .
that said , i do appreciate its sold stainless steel construction , which will resist rust for many more years than lesser models

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels as well as other quality products .
these cooking vessels are cast from molten iron poured in sand moulds which are used only once .
for this reason , one pan may look like another , but each is unique in its own way .
cast iron is a highly efficient material which absorbs and distributes heat .
due to this efficiency , it is recommended that cooking with cast iron is done on low to medium heat .
over heating may cause foods to stick to the pan , or worse burn and can cause the enamel to appear stained .
remove cast iron from the heat and it does not cool off quickly .
this helps your food stay warm while serving .
the opposite holds true as well , chill the pan and it will retain its chill for a surprisingly long time .
beware ; iron tends to be heavy so these cooking vessels tend to be heavier than other pans made from alternate materials .
cast iron is an effective material for cooking so why cover it with enamel ?
iron tends to rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) does n't add any complimentary flavors to your food .
if your cast iron cooking vessel was not enameled , you would have to season and maintain its cooking surface .
adding the porcelain enamel not only looks good , but has multiple benefits .
the enamel , being a solid coating , is one of the most hygienic surfaces to cook on , does not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , and is easy to clean .
the enamel can be damaged , so limit contact to heat resistant plastic or wood utensils to eliminate the scratching and scoring the porcelain .
the benefits of cooking with le creuset cast iron are many , but lets get down to the french oven , cocotte or as it 's also referred to , the dutch oven specifically .
french ovens have been manufactured by le creuset for over 75 years , and were developed well before then .
in all this time the design has stayed constant , affirming the relevance of its cooking qualities .
these ovens come in either oval or round shapes .
the oval shape works well for roasting whole chickens and porkloin roasts , otherwise the differences are minimal .
this pan holds 6 3/4 quarts of food , measures 9 1/2 x 12 inches or 24 x 30 cm internal diameter , 4 3/4 inch or 11 1/2 cm deep , and weighs 13 pounds .
the domed lid provides a tight seal , trapping in moisture to roll back into the dish .
the lid may alternatively be used as a holding plate for chopped vegetables or meat during initial preparations .
be sure to lift the pan off of cooking surfaces to reduce damaging either the pan or the surface .
french oven tends to do best if at least 3/4 full .
any less and you may overwhelm your food with heat evenly dispersed in the pot .
french ovens were developed for slow cooking by stewing , braising or boiling .
some typical dishes include roasts , and stews .
other possibilities include gumbos , chili , dirty rice , baked beans , swedish meatballs , osso bucco , or curing ice cream to name a few .
one feature that people tend to complain about is the cost .
the cost does seem steep compared to other pans made from other materials .
heck , cast iron does n't seem like it should be expensive when comparing to the old cast iron pans past generations have used for cornbread and camping .
however the manufacturing process requires making a mould for each and every pan produced .
they then go through the enameling process before shipping these heavy pans .
if you take what goes into making and distributing these high quality cast iron products , the cost tends to make sense .
then consider that this pan will easily last a lifetime when taken care of .
pros :
efficient absorption and distribution of heat
hygienic enamel cooking surface
does not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors
cleans easily when not abused or misused
can be transferred from stove top to the oven to the table
easily lasts a lifetime

cons :
its heavy , as cast iron tends to be weighing in at about 13 pound

this pot rocks .
you 'll fall in love with it the first time you cook with it .
it browns well , cleans easily , and goes from the stove to the oven to the table in style .
my only complaint is that mine arrived slightly chipped , but the chips do n't seem to affect its performance , so i did n't send it back

this product is great for making mashed potatoes .
i love it , it is well made and sturdy .
my kids like to turn the handle and i do not have to worry about any electric blades cutting their fingers .

i used the four large slider discs to move an 8 ' x 10 ' gambrel roofed framed shed a few feet on a cement pad ( after building the mini-barn & painting it ) .

le creuset made a decent effort in making a cast iron chinese-styled wok .
it looks like a chinese wok , and it is made of iron , but essentially it is not chinese .
the wok is much thicker than a chinese iron wok , and therefore takes much longer time to warm up .
some american users praised the wok by saying it does not need much fire , yet the essence of chinese stir-frying is cooking through large fire : one heats a thin chinese carbon iron wok with large fire , puts in vegetable or animal oil , and then does the entire stir frying in less than a few minutes .
still , i liked the wok after purchasing it .
the chinese food here in the us usually is not really chinese food in essence , but people like it .
why should i be so critial to a french cast iron wok which looks like a chinese wok ?

i 've stir fried in this pan quite a few meals , including carmelizing onions with soy sauce .
when used with medium heat , cleaning is very easy .
soaking it for a few minutes and then scrubbing with scotch bright for a minute works .
i 've done this also with high heat , it needed more scrubbing but after a few minutes it looked new .
if you do n't mind the extra scrubbing , as i do n't , you 'll be happy with a healthier alternative to non-stick pans .
my experience shows that with a few minutes of scrubbing the advantages of nonstick can be matched even in the worst case scenario .
i 'm a bit ambivalent about the size .
i cook for myself and thought 9 " would suffice , but i did n't take into account the fact that i cook for 2-3 days at a time .
this pan is a bit too small in that capacity .
on the other hand , my stove top is tiny so it fits fine .
the handle is beautiful and well designed .
i have no problem holding the pan even when full in one hand and it 's well insulated .
in contrast , i also own the simply calphalon sauce pan with a handle that 's barely suitable for the weight .
the quality of this pan is evident .
all in all , a very high quality product that will serve me for years

regarding the " glue " issue .
the cutting board came to me as described in lisa dryer 's review below : shrink-wrapped in plastic .
however , the product 's label was adhered to the surface of the cutting board with a big glob of what appears to be that clear sticky stuff they use to hold inserts in magazines , etc .
.....and it adheres to bamboo , for sure .
i managed to get most of it off , but a thin layer remains .
i figure that " goof-off " or some other solvent would get rid of it , but i do n't want to put poison on something that 'll be holding my food .
one solution is to use only one side of the cutting board .
otherwise , it appears to be a perfectly fine product

we have been using these for several years now .
for refrigerator storage and reheating , we use these containers almost daily .
i remember the lids were a bit stiff at first , but not impossible unless you are over 80 .
after 5 or 6 times through the dishwasher , they were prefect and remain so .
they nest nicely and they fit in the dishwasher and come out looking good .
the vent is not that exciting a feature , but if it was n't there you 'd have more microwave clanup .
regardless , i highly recommend these

so far i have made several different ice creams in my new machine .
this is the first i 'd ever had and the hard part is making the different recipies and deciding what you like and what you do n't .
the machine is very efficient .
you just put the mixture in and it does all the work .
you may want to check on your mixture a few times because some thicken earlier than others .
you just stop it and give a taste to see if you like the consistency .
i made one mistake of putting the mixture in before it was completely cooled and it did n't thicken and i wasted all of it , so be sure it is completely cool before you put it in the machine .
the machine is a little noisy but i expected that after reading about it , not as bad as i thought it would be though .
overall , very happy

this color of fiesta is just gorgeous and a great addition to any collection .
my sister-in-law , for whom this was a gift , just loves it and i 'd be tempted to buy a set for myself if i did n't already have a ton of dishes .
the fiesta line are all well made , solid dishes that can be used for all occasions .
if you know someone needing dishes , the fiesta line is the way to go .
these dishes increase in value regularly and add a lovely touch of color to your table

i looked for somewhere to find these corelle plates and found them on amazon .
my favorite dish and plate design should last a while and withstand my abuse

</review_text>
<review_text>

this plate , the 10 inch is the normal size dinner plate , just so you know .
it 's easy to buy the wrong size with these because they come in so many sizes .
my aunt has had the winter frost white as long as i can remember , and now i am slowly building my own collection .
i love them - they are very light and strong .
i tried throwing a plate on the kitchen floor and it is still intact .
the material feels like a combination of porcelin and pyrex as weird as that sounds .
they are so thin and light that i could probably carry at least 35 of them .
this is perfect for your everyday meals .
highly recommended

</review_text>
<review_text>

the combination of the great price and incredible durability makes this stuff perfect for just about everyone .
both i and my parents have been using corelle dinnerware for over 15 years , and are amazed at how well they hold up

i recently received this pan as a gift , and have been extremely impressed with it !
the " infused anodized " surface performs as advertised , providing a terrific hybrid between regular and non-stick cooking .
i love the 14 " size -- it 's great for those times when i used to have to split things up into more than one 10 " saute pan , as well as for one-pan stovetop-to-oven dishes .
that said , this is definitely not the right pan for you if you prefer non-stick surfaces .
you will need to use oil , butter , etc .
when cooking in this pan , and things will sometimes stick .
cleanup is very easy , though !
it is very well-constructed , and i would expect it to last a lifetime

this is one of my favorite knives - and i have quite a collection of them , believe me .
it 's sturdy , sharpens easily , and seems to contour to my hand when chopping .
i 'm a faster sous chef for myself and others with this knife .

this brand across the board is one of my all-time favorites .
i 've never been disappointed with a knife i purchased from victorinox

the food processor has many many organized accessories that were sent with the purchase .
i know i was buying a good brand but it was not just a good product it 's an excellent food processor and worth more than the money .

also it has a juice maker not mentioned in the add woooow .
the seller was more than excellent .

this low cost loaf pan does everything you would expect a loaf pan to do .
it 's dark color absorbs enough heat to produce desired browning .
it also releases cleanly .
the protruding lips serve as handles ( although if they were a little bigger they 'd be easier to grip while wearing oven mitts ) .
all in all , this is an excellent buy for a loaf pan - you should buy two since many recipes call for making two loaves

these bags and all of the foodsaver brand bags are flawless .
the only way they would fail is if they are being used wrong .
if you do ebay you can get these same 32 count gallon bags for about $ 10.99 + $ 5.50 for shipping .
and sometimes you can find a seller that will combine shipping for multiple boxes .
i purchaced 3 boxes of gallon 32 cnt bags for $ 32.97 + $ 9.00 for shipping .
also keep in mind that you can wash and re-use these bags as long as they did not hold any kind of meat and that they have never been boiled .
i have used them multiple times for things like corn on the cob

ok so i got this set for free , but i would have paid something for it .

i suppose color choices would be nice ; choice is almost always good .
but my smaller golden loves it .
she likes the view it gives her and it 's room and she does n't paw at the sides .
my larger golden ( 118 lbs - and no he 's not fat ; he 's just a tall , tall golden ) would paw at the sides and that could spell disaster with this crate .
she thinks is very cool and i like the weight of it for being prepared to hit the road when the next hurricane is announced .
he has a big folding metal crate and that suits him

what you see is what you get .
it works just fine , there is n't really much that could go wrong .

this teapot was a good buy all in all .
it 's true about how the leaves container does n't stay in a static position... this concerned me at first , but it has n't been a problem .
the tea press will slide down over time without leaves in the pot , i put it in the leaves container on an angle and this stops that from happening .
i have never had a problem loosing heat to fast from this pot , contrary to previous reviews .
yeah , some things could be better quality... but considering the price i 'd call it a good buy

oh , it opens bottles very well too

all the hype is true .
the sensations are sinful , but totally legal .
i 'm still embarrassed that i spent that much money on a dessert maker , but i do n't regret a penny of it .
when i clean the machine , i only wish i had a tongue long enough to lap up every drop .
i hide from the kids so i can lick the paddle blades alone .
" normal " ice cream from this machine can send you into another realm , but italian-style gellato will deliver you to a level of transcendence previously thought impossible here on earth .
slowly heat four cups of fresh cream in a large pot to just below a simmer ( surface will start to shimmer ) .
in a small pot , melt four ounces of best bittersweet chocolate on lowest heat .
in a large , deep bowl , beat four fresh egg yolks on high speed and gradually add 2/3 cups sugar .
slowly pour the hot cream into the yolks and sugar .
mix in 1/2 cup of ground chocolate ( ghiardelli , for example ) .
add melted chocolate and return to large pot .
heat mixture to about 160 degrees , stirring frequently , and cook until it thickens ( about fifteen or twenty minutes ) .
do n't let it get above 165 degrees , or it might burn .
remove from heat , cool , and place in refrigerator for at least an hour .
pour into musso , turn on machine , and prepare yourself .
tell only your closest , dearest loved ones

i 've had this cookware since 1991 .
it has performed exactly as promised .
regardless of all the use ( this is the hardest working piece in the set ) it 's in great shape .
i use it for so many things , sauteing vegetables , a large omelette ( to share ) .
a 10 " skillet is a must have and more than one is even better .
please never use aerosol cooking sprays .
a " pumped " spray is recommended or just pour a little oil or a pat of butter for more flavor .
great even heat and total release , even when cheese is used .
fast easy hand wash

these scissors are ideal for the kitchen .
the size is nice , good grips fit well in the hand .
they are sharp and appear to be easy to sharpen for the future .
i especially like that they come apart easily for cleaning... and go back together easily also .
highly recommend if you 're looking for a good quality , all-purpose kitchen scissor

these shears are indispensable .
first they are sharp and stay that way---definitely not to be used by children .
they will definitely bone a chicken all by themselves ( but i spare mine a little by using poultry shears to cut heavier bone ) .easy to handle .
but best of all , they come apart and go back together with extreme ease , yet stay together for use .
contrary to the description , it is not necessary to use the cap and screw to get them apart .
they are well designed with a slot and protrusion arrangement that allow them to be separated for cleaning with a single motion and to be rejoined the same way .
the cap and screw are only necessary for sharpening .
you 'll wonder how you ever got along without them

i first heard of the delonghi mixer when it was branded kenwood -in an australian magazine .
what a nice difference !
the kitchen aid now appears to be so antiquated by comparison ! !
i love the very practical easy to clean design and construction of the delonghi as well as the physical ability of the unit to mix more content in a more complete manner .
i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product .

i was a kitchenaid fan .
i had the special edition 350 watt and burned the motor out twice in just a couple of years .
when it burned out the 2nd time i decided not to spend another $ 100 + on repairs .
i bought this delonghi and love it .
the splash guard is great and convenient to use ( i 'd never used the kitchenaid splash guard because it was too much trouble ) .
now i do n't know how i ever lived without one--no more white dust all over my counters .
the power is more than i 'll ever need but at least i do n't have to worry about burning the motor out .
it is very easy to change attachments .
you can even change them while the splash guard is on .
it is also very easy to clean .
great buy

if you like your friday cocktail , and enjoy having people over to enjoy it with you , then get an ice bucket and some tongs .
i purchased this one when my old one rusted out and like it much better .
it 's just classy enough , without seeming snooty , and holds a nice amount of ice .
just fill it , stick it on your bar or table , and then you do n't have to worry about continually opening up the freezer

i love this dutch oven .
do n't even debate whether or not you should buy it .... just buy it .
you will not regret it .
i 'm consistently amazed at how well food turns out after cooking in it .
after buying it i tend to use it in place of my all clad pieces .
amazing

i absolutely love this cookware .
do n't be put off by the seemingly high price .
you will hand this stuff down to your kids .
what 's so special about it ?
it out performs all of my other cookware ( yes , even all-clad ) on the stovetop and in the oven .
the even heating is better than i could have imagined .
it will even perform despite the crappiest cooktops .
and , as an added bonus , it 's the easiest to clean .
i use mine for most everything .
.
.
pot roast , soup , stew , pasta sauces , braising , slow-cooking , etc .
it 's great

i find this timer very easy to use .
i 'm not a rocket scientist .
i have never been disappointed with kitchen aid .
i do n't understand why it has gotten bad reviews .
i think some people should stick with a sun dial

i received this item last week and immediately tried it .
it was easy to use and worked quite fast .
needed much less marinating juice to get the job done .
i wish it was also available in a bigger size for a larger group .

i only use the brisk brew for heating water while on vacation....i 'm a tea drinker .
my ex husband got custody of the first one we bought , so the search was on .
when i could n't find it in the stores i went on line .
as soon as i saw the exact same i ordered it .
it works great , and travels light !

having now owned this device for three months , i found it to be a very useful device to have around if you need hot water and there is n't any or no way to get any .
its lightweight , very portable and compact .
while listed as a coffee maker , it brewed very slowly and not all that well .
but as a hot water heater , it served fantastically well .
the typical 8 oz water will heat through the system in about 4-5 minutes , so little patience is needed .
the device seem to overheat a bit so cool down period would be wise between uses .
there 's an automatic shut off , the machine come with two plastic containers that fit inside the water hold .
it also come with a small spoon .
machine often come on by itself even before you hit the " on " button , probably if you hit the button before you plug it in .
i would recommended that you have everything set up before hand .
i used this device at work quite a bit and found it to be super handy thanks to the small size .
the following products could be considered as tailored made for this device : lipton cup a soup ( sheer perfect for this machine ) , general food international coffee mixes and various kind of hot chocholate brands .
it also great for tea bags as well .
i am not sure about brewing tea though .
overall , this device come highly recommended for anyone who might like to have a hot drink when there 's none available

this baster is big enough to accomplish most tasks , and it even makes a great costume accessory on halloween .
except that when i used it as part of my halloween party costume along with a doctor 's lab coat and stethoscope , all the women blushed and left the room .
oh well , maybe next time i 'll come as a proctologist

i have le creuset and calphalon pots and pans but i find myself constantly reaching for this farberware pot .
the design is why i bought it .
i would have been willing to pay $ 100 for one just like it from calphalon or le creuset but this is the only one of its kind i could find anywhere online .
it does n't have the weight of my other pots but the sheer practicality of being able to strain your food without worries of burning yourself ( the spouts are great ) or using another dish far outweights any reservations on possible durability .
kudos to farberware for coming up with such an ingenious and sensible design .
it makes one wonder if the other brands out there ever listen to their customers

i bought this as a birthday gift to myself and i love it .
i thought i would miss being able to preset my coffee timer at night to wake up to coffee , but this makes it so quickly that has not been a factor .
the taste is unbeatable !
even if you leave the warmer on the entire morning the coffee never tastes bitter .
highly recommended for coffee lovers !

this is an outstanding device .
in several i 've had before the cutter blades were not fastened to the center piece .
they would flex as the coring progressed and the slices would be rendered a mess .
this corer has rigidly attached blades and therefore cuts clean , perfect slices every time

this casserole dish has some minor inconveniences .
it 's made of some sort of pottery so it cools down very slowly and it 's easy to let something sit for 15 minutes and come back and burn your hand .
i also learned through this dish that square casserole dishes are easier to cut brownies out of than round or oval ones .
it does however cook things just fine and is not too large for what i need it for

</review_text>
<review_text>

le creuset baking dishes are an investment in good cooking for a lifetime .
this 11 1/2-inch size oval dish is similar in size and shape to a medium-sized au gratin .
it is large enough to bake two large fish fillets or four boneless chicken breasts or a casserole .
many times , i double a casserole recipe and put half in this dish and then freeze it for later use .
i bring the dish right from the oven to the table for serving , and i find its clean-up is easy afterward

the only complaint from the other reviews that i can agree with is that the amount of froth on the milk is hard to control .
i certainly do n't have any trouble getting hot milk .
my taste in coffee is probably not very sophisticated , but this machine produces espresso and latte as good as i 've had in america .
i 've had my espressopro for 3 years and it 's still working well .
when i first bought the machine , it did n't work , and the capresso people were wonderful and immediately sent a new machine .
then there was a mixup over the color ( silver vs chrome ) , and again the capresso people were wonderful and sent a new machine .
both times they sent me a machine immediately , with packaging to send my old machine back , so i had a new machine within two days of calling them .
i always use espressione coffee pods , and filtered water .
that 's just what is most convenient for me .
i 've never actually cleaned the machine 's innards , and i have n't noticed any degradation in performance over the years .
the milk attachment is very convenient .
we wash ours about once a week , although we do have to wash the little siphon/nozzle thing every day .
it 's about as much work as a stainless jug i guess , with the advantage that you 're not wasting milk every time you make a latte .
the downside to the milk attachment is that i have n't found a way to get a lot of froth out of it .
it 's got a little knob on top that is supposed to control the amount of froth .
it does a good job of controlling the temperature of the frothed milk , but no matter what i do , i almost always end up with around 1/2 inch of froth on my latte .
occasionally i end up with a lot more or almost none , but i have no idea why .
that 's my biggest complaint .
the bit where the coffee comes out into your cup ( you can see my level of sophistication there ) has two holes , so it can pour into two cups at once .
this is worthless .
the coffee never comes out evenly , and if you use pods you can only make a single shot at a time anyway .
the end result of the two holes is that whenever i make an espresso , some of it dribbles down the side of the cup instead of going in .
it 's also a bit short for any latte glass i 've ever found , and you have to tilt the glass to get it under .
despite the fact that the espressopro does n't look particularly tough ( it 's mostly plastic , and not really heavy plastic at that ) , mine is still going strong after three years .
much to the dismay of my grandparents , three years is considered long enough to classify something as " durable " thesedays .
so there you go .
i 'm sure there are machines that make better espresso , but for convenience , i have n't seen any machines that can touch this one for less than twice the price .
there are a couple of things i 'd like to change ( milk froth control and height of coffee dispenser ) , but i would still recommend it

when my braun flavorselect coffee maker unexpectedly stopped working , i had to scramble to find a new machine .
i wanted another braun , but unfortunately , they seem to have stopped making a 12 cup coffee maker .
so i had to begin an intense search for a machine that had the features i wanted combined with good value .
i finally found it with this cuisinart model .
the advantages ?
for one , it makes excellent and hot coffee .
the carafe is solidly constructed and fits securely in square body so there 's no chance of someone accidentally knocking it loose .
because the lid fits tightly , the pour is precisely narrow and smooth , with no side leaks even when the pot is full .
the basket fits inside the housing instead of swinging free like so many models which prevents a misalignment between the water and the filter ; the conical ( krups/braun style ) basket accepts both paper filters and gold-tone , although i learned the hard way that not all gold filters fit .
the timer is very easy to program , as is the clock .
the carafe warmer can be set at low , medium , or high for the temperature that 's right for you .
i found the " high " setting too hot since i drink my coffee black ( i like my coffee hot but not scalding !
) , but those who add a lot of milk might appreciate it .
the brewing is quick and efficient , with the process taking about a minute a cup , maybe less .
the retro/stainless look complements most modern kitchen dcors .
there 's a 1-4 cup setting to make sure such small amounts stay hot , and you can select how long the warmer remains on .
the pot beeps five times when brewing is complete and just before the warming plate shuts off .
parts are top rack dishwasher safe .
it comes with a water filter system designed to improve the taste of the brew .
but the cuisinart does have disadvantages .
the water reservoir is located on the right side , in the back , which makes it a little challenging for lefties like me to dump the final bit of water inside even though the carafe pours very accurately .
although i have n't yet missed the opening , i do struggle briefly with those last few drops unless i use my right hand .
the housing is fairly tall , so if your counter space is only under the cabinets , you may not be able to lift the top in its entirety .
( this is when the small rear reservoir becomes a major issue as you have to have room to completely lift the rather large top toward the back .
) clearance required : 7.5 " wide by 8.5 " deep of counter space with no overhead obstruction to pull out for filling or 21.5 " of overhead space to fully lift top .
without the top open , the coffee maker measures 7.5 " w x 8.5 " d x 14.25 " h .

if you have the space for this coffee maker , you 'll love it .
i ca n't attest to how long it will last , but , as it comes with a three year warranty , i 'm hoping for a good run

this pan heats up evenly , no hot or cool spots , and the handles stay cool .
it 's great for cooking bacon or scrambling eggs .
cuisinart recommends not turning the heat up to high , and so far , it has n't been necessary .
very good value .

i have been using a cuisinart 9 " skillet for a few years now and love it - one of the best pans i 've ever owned ( and i 've owned a few -top names too ) .
but when my 13 " stainless steel skillet ( from another name ) warped under too much heat ( it could n't take the heat from my viking range ) , i immediately started a search for a cusinart replacement .
i could n't believe the price .
fortunately i have the lid from the previous pan because the cusinart does n't come with one

the kitchenaid professional 5 plus ( kv25g0x ) is a great product , but you should buy it elsewhere .
we ordered it from amazon , and got the commercial ( km25g0x ) instead .
we did not want that , so contacted customer service .
they said they 'd exchange it , but they sent us another km25g0x .
no good , obviously .
then , the customer service representative claimed they could not reliably get in touch with the warehouse , so they had no idea whether they ever actually would get the item they advertise .
they said they sometimes substituted similar products .
great .
at this point we gave up , and ordered instead straight from the manufacturer

i have enjoyed my new kitchenaid .
i 'm thinking that i may have liked the smaller model that has the beater that tips up instead of having the bowl lifter , as it is awkward sometimes working around the beater .
overall , i am happy and can mix a lot in a short amount of time

the cirtus juicer works great ( like all kitchen aid products ) but it 's pricy by the time you pay $ 8 to ship it .
however my local outlet mall wanted over $ 30 for it plus tax. .

i received these as a christmas gift and am very pleased with them .
they are very thin so it makes gripping things out of the oven a lot easier than with thick mitts - and they 'll take up less room in your drawer .
highly recommend - worth the extra money

you know , for this price , you could throw anything away .
but , this 'synthetic ' comforter is so soft , silky and light , i can toss it on and not feel weighted down .
i also have a cat and with cat hairs i can vacumn them off easily ( down is more difficult ) , but just having the airy warmth is worth it .

i 've used this set for several years now and have been very pleased with the overall cutting ability of these knives .
even though i also own global and shun kitchen knives , i find myself being drawn to the insignia knives when i am in a hurry or in the middle of a large project .
although both the global and the shun have sharper edges , their price difference does n't equate directly to the increased level of sharpness that you get .
that is to say , yes global and shun knives are sharper , but they are not three to four hundred percent sharper all though their price difference certainly would suggest that .
using my insignia knives , i am able to quickly dice , cut , and slice through onions , carrots , chicken , roasts , etc .
that said , there are several cavets that need to be stated .
first , do n't wash these knives in a dishwasher .
it has nothing to do with the quality of the steel .
i would n't wash my ken onion shun chef 's knife in the dishwasher and that one knife costs as much as two whole sets of the insignia .
second , these knives need to be honed regularly .
a few strokes after every use makes a real difference .
third , after owning the knives for almost two years , i sharpened each of the knives on oil stones .
these knives , like all knives will need to be resharpened from time to time .
the good news is that they resharpened quite nicely , a tribute to their quality .
since resharpening , they have continued to hold their edges .
last , the balance of these knives is more than adequate .
i also own the matching sanduko and have found it to be the best of the series .
all though i am a bit of a knife snob , and although i would love to purchase a block set of either the shun or the globals , i ca n't justify it given that the insignia 's cut so well .
my wife would really give me no end of grief if i threw out a perfectly good set of knives .
and a good set of knives these are

my living room ( approx 12'x16 ' and open to the kitchen ) was always the last room to cool down after a hot day .
it sometimes took most of the night to cool despite standing a powerful fan in front of it .
the bionaire bw2300 cools it in half the time it used to take .
~ edit : my statement that this fan cools my liviing room in half hte time i once did is inaccurate .
if the outside temp is lower than inside , the fan cools the living room in just a couple of hours. ~

it also does a great job circulating air when its hot out ( and in ) to keep the room from feeling stuffy .
i have not experienced the temperature gauge problem that other reviewers have .
the temp gauge on mine works well .
~ edit : the thermometer reads the temp of fan 's exact location , not the room 's temperature .
for example , in the afternoon sun , mine consistently registers a much higher temp than the actual room tempature .
when it is colder outside at night , it registers a slightly colder temp than the room temp .
~

is it really quiet ?
yes !
i have a vornado fan , which is quite quiet for a fan .
this is even quieter ( although not silent ) .
to accomodate different window sizes , this model comes with a built-in extender , and two add-on extenders .
the fan with extenders is n't large enough to fit my 38.5 " window width .
i could order another add-on extender from the manufacturer , but stuffed a wash cloth in the gap instead .
what comes in the box ?
the fan , two extenders , two aaa batteries and the remote .
~ edited 7/28/06 :
i bought a second one for my bedroom .
its thermometer is completely inaccurate and overstates the temperature until the outside temp is about 75 degrees .
the slats which the air blows through are fixed on this model .
so i can not direct the air onto ( or away from ) a particular area of the room .
