he just looks away from where the spray emits--and barks again !
it also does n't work 100 % of the time...and we 're not sure why .
when we fill it , it seems to work fairly well right after but it either does not have as many sprays as it is supposed to , or it is n't working very long .
it does work well for my other small dog who is not such a persistent barker .
terriers are just too stubborn to care if they 're getting sprayed , i guess .

having read the other reviews of this product on this site , i decided to go ahead and give these collars a shot despite some of the problems other reviewers had encountered .
i ordered three of these products from this site , and when they arrived , not a single one of them worked - at all .
they were completely useless and despite trying everything other reviewers and the manufacturer suggested , these products are completely useless .
although i have contacted the manufacturer of this product about the defects , i would still like the buyer to be aware that if purchasing this product from this website , that if the product does not work , it can not be returned for a refund or even exchanged .
thus , your credit card will still be billed , your dogs will still be barking , and you may get stuck with products that are worthless .

sometimes it sprays when she barks , most of the time it does n't .
so i would say its effectiveness has been rather low .
it 's not the battery or the fill level - maybe it just depends on the dog .
i can bark into it myself and it sprays just fine .
( my children found this amusing .

this item is cheaply made and i sent it back .
the picture looks cool but it 's deceiving .
the minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side , it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left , it plopped down to the left .
it could n't keep the right time

initially , my dogs found the sound interesting and slowed down on barking , but after a couple of days they acted like they did n't even hear the sound .
now , they are back to " bark all you want "

i bought this product hoping it would solve my problem with my barking terrier .
he did n't even notice it was there .
i put it near his crate and it still did n't stop him from barking .
i pushed the manual button and still nothing .
it promises to stop annoying barking , but it did n't stop my dog for one minute .
it was a complete waste of my money

our dogs did n't even notice it .

read the description carefully .
it states the speaker range is 50 ' not the microphone .
my dog stood 10 ' away from it and even with the sensitivity on high and her barking right at the thing it would n't trigger .
matter of fact i never could get it to trigger with barking .
the only time it did go off was when i put the batteries in for the first time and my husband was mowing the lawn on his big riding mower and he knocked into a chicken wire fence which made me run out to get it with the unit in my hand .
even then it did n't go off till i was about 4 feet from the mower .
i also could n't get it to just make the ultrasonic sound .
even when switched from audible to ultrasonic you still hear a noise .
not just me but my husband too so it 's not a case of super human hearing on my part : - )

yes the timer option is very nice .
this was actually why i purchased this one over the others as we only wanted to stop the night barking .
but what good is the timer function if the microphone ca n't pick up the barking ?
so read these descriptions carefully when looking at these control units .
unless your dog always barks in the same spot and you can place this unit under 4 feet from them then pick something else .

i have had my super bark free for 3 years .
never really worked the way i hoped but i spent so much on it i keep trying .
well now it does n't work .
ca n't turn it off and it does n't cycle when the dog barks .
i called lentek and the pleasant young man on the phone told me if it was within the warranty period " 1 year " they would just replace it .
i told him i was willing to pay to have it repaired .
he said , " we are just the distributor and do n't support repairs of our product .
that is the key , " they do not support their product "

super bark free did n't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor 's dog 's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it ( though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet ) .
i 'm mad that i wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product .
if you decide to purchase super bark free , be sure it 's returnable for a full refund if it does n't live up to its claims .
and in the meantime , shop around for a more effective product

the one item in your house that you really wish would suck and it certainly does n't !
this thing blows more air than it sucks dirt .
what a useless thing .
i 'm looking for one that will actually pick up the dirt from the recessed areas of my prefinished floor .
this thing certainly does n't do it !

the design for using the dc adapter with led booklight is extremely poor .
it is possible that i missed the warning that tells you to remove the batteries before using the dc adapter .
but , it must not have been very big .
i combined the two and ended up with batteries that leaked all over inside the battery case .
these were brand new batteries .
there does not seem to be anything protecting the batteries from the dc adapter and so the power goes right into them .
this is bad .
modern devices are expected to work with either battery or adapter without having to remove the batteries .
i had assumed that i could leave the batteries in so that when i was at home i could use the adapter , but traveling i would use the batteries .
do n't make this mistake

there are a lot of theoretically good ideas that fail when executed .
this is one of them .
1/quality : it 's made cheaply , and even before it breaks , it 's flimsiness does not inspire confidence .
2/resistance : the levels of resistance have nothing to do with real progression , as anyone who 'seriously ' uses this will be too strong for the machine in a few weeks , ( many will be unchallenged right from the beginning ) .
the standard : if the set is longer than a minute and you still have strength to continue , you need more resistance .
3/compared to crunches : there 's a reason why crunches are done lying down : the weight of the torso supplies a fairly heavy resistance , whereas when you crunch in an uptight position the weight of the torso actually helps the effort , as you are dropping your weight down instead of lifting it up .
much of what makes the ab crunch machine 'work ' is your weight dropping on it , not your muscles working .
this little piece of plastic does n't have springs strong enough to resist your bodyweight and strengthen your muscles besides .
( you may achieve an isometric contraction that has some effect , but you can get -exactly- this effect , or -better- , without any equipment at all !
just tense up in seated crunch position for minute or so. ) .. .
of course , by the time a product is appealing to the public by claiming how supposedly -huge- a hassle lying down ( ? ?
) to do crunches is , we 've reached the real problem : this thing is designed to avoid effort .
it seems as though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort .
unfortunately , exercise is effort , and the more you avoid effort , the less exercise you get

being somewhat of an insomniac i read well into the hours of the night and a book light is essential to me .
i therefore purchased the itty bitty booklight .
if you do use this light it is essential to purchase the power supply for two reasons .
firstly , there is no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly .
secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard on the eyes and difficult to read resulting in the constant need for new batteries .
this light is also extremely fragile .
over a couple of years i went through 7 of these !
i would not recommend this light - for the amount you spend on the never-ending purchasing of batteries or the expensive power supply , and the constant new purchases after it breaks , you might as well splurge and buy a decent book light .
i now have the tri lite by capstone enterprises ( available at barnes & nobel - come on and get it in stock amazon !
) it is terrific !
it has a clock with an alarm and a timer .
you can set it to stay on for any period of time and once it reaches that time the light flashes .
at that time you can extend the minutes .
if you do n't do so , for example you 're sleeping , it will automatically shut off .
it also produces much more light and is much brighter than the itty bitty book light

</review_text>
<review_text>

why does this light cost 30 $ ?
for this price and supposedly a bunch of " design awards " , i find this light to be of extremely poor quality .
the connection between the chord and the a/c adapter is loose and tends to fall out with the slightest notion of tension .
the chord is also very sensitive and needs to be jiggled to get the light to stay on .
i am still looking for a better alternative , but for the price , this light is n't worth the investment .

this product does separate the fat but small bits of meat or vegetables will stop up the spout and the plastic is not heat resistant .

<review_text>

once upon a time , not too long ago , they made and sold fat separators that permitted the juice to flow out from the bottom of the separator .
this meant that the cook could harvest all of the juice , plus the tasty bits , instead of , as with this product , having to strain the sauce first ( for the bits ) and then sacrifice some of the sauce ( a small amount to be sure ) , lest the fat start to flow through the spout as well .
this product is really just a step away from spoon and ice cube , and not a big step , considering that it 's not a complete solution .
if the cooks 's purpose were to collect the fat--e.g. , chicken schmalz--free from juices , it would present the same problems

the hose attachment is horrible , the hose is about 4 ft long and stiff and is not permanently attached to the vacuum , and when you try to clean furniture the movement losens it and it comes off .

also when you could use the hose on something all the dirt piled up on the floor where the vacuum stood , it was not pulled into the bag .

i decided to give this product a shot .
some reviewers said the bags would work properly if you do n't overstuff them -- still not true !
a large bag re-inflated when i put 2 standard pillows in it .
so i took out 1 pillow and tried again , and the bag was nowhere near being full .
it seemed to work all right , but the next morning the pillow had re-inflated !
and if you buy the bags with the zippers , the zippers come off easily , they make sealing more difficult , and one even tore a hole in the bag .
i purchased straight from asseenontv.com , but their return policy looks a little weird .
i 'm not sure if i 'll get a refund .
also be careful if you order straight from asseenontv.com -- i upgraded to express shipping and got my package 12 days later !
i guess the product was just too good to be true .

this is the worst basting brush i have ever encountered .
at first countless bristles fell out in my food and every time i washed it .
( although it 's dishwasher safe , it failed to come clean in there , even after a big squirt of dawn and much hand washing it is n't spotless , but i think i pulled most of the loose bristles out in the process .
) it also does n't stand up to any heat , i use it to lightly grease my griddle for pancakes and things ( at about 375 degrees ) becuase i do n't like the residue left by pam , and it shrinks and flakes bristle bits every time .
i also do n't like the good grips in general ( these were a gift ) the handles are too bulky and take up too much space in my utensil crock and limited apartment kitchen drawers

last year , i bought a pizza stone from pampered chef .
it was a rousing success with my family .
for the 5 of us , however , one stone was not enough and i wanted a companion that would help provide two delicious pizzas at one time .
sadly , the product did not come through .
my pizza stuck to the stone and had to be scraped off .
i tried going against the directions and did n't preheat the stone the second time .
it stuck even worse !
the pizza did n't get fully done in the middle , while the pampered chef pizza was perfect both times .
i will be throwing the stone away and ordering the higher priced alternative from pampered chef .
you get what you pay for !

i thought i was getting a true cooking stone - but it is only a bread stone .
can not cook other foods on it .
i thought i was getting something similar to pampered chef cooking stone where i could cook meat , cookies , etc .

if all you want is pizza or bread this may be the item - but it is very limited in use for the amount of space it takes up in the cabinet .

purchased the unit about 6 months ago and have never been happy with it .
the heating plate under the pot started to rust ; the pot leaks every time it 's poured ; it 's almost impossible to pour water into the water chamber without spilling it ; the handle of the coffee basket broke within a few months ; and two days ago the entire top of the unit snapped off when we opened it to pour in the water .
we purchased this unit because of the cuisinart brand and the stainless steel carafe .
we will not purchase another

i am a big fan of espresso and espresso drinks but needed to save money so i bought this to make it at home .
making espresso is easy enough if you follow the instructions ( i did n't watch the video ) .
the frother even works well .
the problem i had was with the flavor .
the manual suggests making two or four shots of espresso at a time , but when making four shots the espresso was badly burned by the time it was finished brewing .
i had best results making just over one shot at a time , but the flavor was still burned and flat .
in the end , i used the machine for a couple months but eventually put it away and went back to my regular drip coffee maker

i ca n't believe this is a rowenta product !
if you decide to disregard the reviews , here are some things from the owners manual ( which i read before using the iron - and followed to the letter ) to give you an idea how temperamental/high-maintenance this item is :

* do not use distilled water .
you can use tap water - if it 's not too hard ( less than 12 grains - who actually knows this ? ) .
softened water can also cause problems .
basically , if you use anything except bottled water , expect problems !
* empty the water from the iron after every use .
failure to do so will result in leaking or spitting

* other than the rowenta soleplate cleaning kits ( which run about $ 12 ) , the only instructions/recommendations for cleaning the soleplate are what not to use .
i had a very inexpensive panasonic iron for years - given panasonic is not really " known " for this type of item , my expectations were not high .
it lasted 7 years with no problems and was low and/or no maintenance .
do n't count on the rowenta name to equate to higher quality on this one

love those irobot products and everything they 're capable of doing .
in fact , this was my third purchase , but my first remanufactured product .
what a headache !
the product worked correctly just three times , then died .
both technical support and customer service from irobot were helpful and prompt , but still took weeks to resolve the issues .
i tried a different way of recharging , which did n't work .
then they replaced the battery , but that still did n't solve the problem .
ultimately i had to send the product back , then waited more than a month for a replacement , which was on backorder .
finally , they substituted a different model , and which works just as advertised .
i 'd never buy another remanufactured model .
but i still believe in irobot .

please note that i have several henckel knives that i really like , so this is definitely not a anti-henckel biased review .
there is really only one problem with this knife - the blade is way too thick .
if there 's only one problem - then why do i give it only one star ?
well , this one problem completely ruins this knife .
the 'eversharp ' name i 'm sure refers to the fact that the serrations are not the standard " wave pattern " you 'd see on most bread knives .
instead , each serration has several smaller serrations and spikes built in .
i know that this is supposed to ensure that the knife will never end up dull - but in the process it makes it horrible at doing any kind of delicate cutting .
plus , the blade is not flexible in any way due to the extreme thickness .
unless you are cutting the sturdiest bread out there , you 'll crush it while trying to slice with this blade .
forget about cutting any kind of soft bread or pastry .
i 've found that some of our cheap steak knives work far better than this knife .
i 've come to the conclusion that this knife is horrible after comparing it to two other bread knives i now own .
the first was a paderno ( small canadian company ) that we got for our wedding , and the second was a global bought from amazon .
both are considerably more expensive than this knife , but there are other , more economical options out there that are still far better .
you want to find a nice , thin blade with even and sharp serrations .
if you 're looking to stay in this price range , you wo n't find anything forged - these will all be stamped or laser cut - but that 's fine - the bread knife does n't need to be strong like your chef 's knife .
pros :
-cheap

cons :
-mashes your bread while it cuts
-hard to get started through crusts due to blade thickness
-the 'spiky ' serrations are dangerous to your fingers ( think many tiny needles along the blade ) - they tend to nick you easily - but they are useless for their intended purpose of cutting bread .
suggestion : steer clear .
if you can afford it , get a global ( or even a better henckel ) .
otherwise , look for a the thin stamped blade

this grill is better in theory than practice .
i 'm not sure it heats to the temp it shows on the display and it really is n't practical for steaks except very thin ones .
it 's pretty handy for hamburgers and also makes good panini sandwiches .

it is easy to clean , so that 's a plus

the only thing this juicer is good for is to find out if you will really be into juicing .
this juicer lasted for 3 months while juicing 3 to 5 times a week ( for two people ) .
at 3 months the tray that holds the blade warped and started spitting plastic into the drink .
i considered getting another one to have spare parts....then i scraped that idea and got a real juicer .
besides being cheaply made...it should also be priced cheaper .
also the blade takes a while to clean

i felt disapointed with the quality of this bake set .
the grill cover started to desapair , and the last time i cooked a stek using this set , the paint sticked to the meat , leaving black spots .
it started to show deteriorazion and everytime i washed i have to dried it up immediately otherwise mark of rust starts to show soon .
the deep pan it is ok , perhaps because i did not used that piece with the same frequency .
i never used metal utensills or harsh detergents durig the cleaning , i always leave it in hot water first and later do the cleaning , to avoid scratches .
thank you for your attention

the temperature markings on this thermometer are not protected !
over time the markings get occluded by grease and if you try to wash the grease off the markings come with it .
this means the thermometer has a short life span for people who rely on the markings for anything ( which granted is not everyone ) .
last time i buy an oven thermometer in which the markings do n't sit behind a glass face !

i could n't wait to get the dyson root 6 - i 've had my dyson dc 07 for 4 years and i love it , so i figured the mini-version would be fantastic .
i have 3 dustbusters ( one on each floor ) and i was looking forward to the dyson version , which i was convinced would be top notch .
i 'm so sorry to be wrong .
first off , having to press the button continuously to make it work is a pain .
and speaking of pain , the root is so heavy and unbalanced - all the weight is in the back which puts a lot of strain on your wrist .
i have n't noticed any difference in suction to a dustbuster , but then again , i do n't suck up bowling balls .
a dustbuster picks up lint and cat litter just as well .
save your money - this dyson ai n't worth it

i was looking for a springform pan for a particular recipe that called for 3&quot ; sides .
i was delighted when i saw that you had one so i ordered it .
the item was misrepresented as the sides are like any other springform with 2&quot ; sides .
i am sure it is a good pan , but it didnot meet my expectations

i just bought this fan and it is too loud !
even on its lowest setting , the noise is a bit much .
it does put out a stiff breeze , but i 'm not sure it 's worth it .
my black and decker tower fan is better

had to return the first one because of a lock malfunction ( it locked but would not unlock ) .
amazon was great about responding immediately and replacing it promptly .
however , the lock on the second one does not work properly , either ( it does n't lock ) , though i will keep it , since keeping little hands safe is not an issue in my home .
this item is a good way of storing blades and disks , but unless cuisinart comes up with a more reliable locking mechanism , do n't count on it to protect small hands from getting into it .

i 've heard of others complaining that these probes will end up failing under " normal " use... something goes wrong at some point , and they just do n't read right anymore .
i love my taylor digital thermometer , and these probes seem to work with the taylor , but i went through 3 probes very quickly .
i use them in my weber barbeque when doing indirect heat cooking .
in spite of the fact that i took care to not route the cable over a burner , or anything of that sort , each probe lasted only 5 or 6 uses .
i had ordered three at one time , and all of them failed in a similar way .
there are other probes available that are better !
there is one available on the internet that is sold as a taylor probe replacement .
these probes look the same ( with the 90-degree elbow bend and the right-angle mini-plug ) , but they have a smooth grey silicone-rubber sheathed cable , instead of a metal braid sheath .
i bought several of these ( reasonably priced , around $ 12 or so ) , and so far , they have worked like champs with no failures and accurate readings from freezing to boiling .
i would not recommend these probes based on my experience with very high failure rates .

when our wonderful cuisanart four-slice toaster finally died , we replaced it with this horrible piece of junk , because it seemed most similar to the old one .
what a mistake !
- even on the lowest setting , this toaster burns the crust at the bottom .
- it is not easy to tell if you have it set for two slices or four .
with the old toaster , it was very easy to see .
- the push-down slider does not move freely and sometimes has to be pushed down two or three times before it engages .
- the old toaster let you select " defrost " and " bagel " at the same time .
the new toaster lets you select one or the other .
all in all , a big waste of money and a major disappointment .

</review_text>
<review_text>

the toast was black on setting 4 , black and dark tan on setting 3 , and dark tan and untoasted on setting 2 .
this is appalling performance for such an expensive toaster , and not worthy of cuisinart

i ordered 3 ( 2x ) sets of these so that i would have a full complement of 6 cookie sheets .
when they arrived , i noted that they were a bit lighter than the commercial quality cookie sheets that i had used previously , but my thinking was that if they baked well , that was all that counted .
i always bake with an exopat silicone mat on my sheets .
upon the first use , when they were placed in the oven , the edges of the cookie sheets turned up about a quarter of an inch - an ominous sign that the sheets are too thin .
the next thing i heard was the tap tap tap of sheets buckling in the oven .
lack of dimensional stability at 350 degrees f translates to poor heat conduction , and burned cookie bottoms .
this symphony of metal buckling , courtesy of my new $ 15 cookie sheets .
even with the exopat silicone sheets on them , the cookies were barely done when i decided to pull them from the oven to save the bottoms from getting burned - typical of cheap , thin cookie sheets that one knows one needs to " double pan " to prevent burning .
what a wonderful situation amazon has presented me with - $ 90 and a garbage can full of cookie sheets .
yes , into the garbage all six sheets went - no matter how costly , its even more so to live with poor quality baking implements and invent work-arounds to augment their performance .
these are no better than inexpensive supermarket cookie sheets - actually they 're worse - with the price-point of supermarket wares , one can infer the quality that one is getting .
i used to believe brands like calphalon stood for quality , and this translated into some assurance that products bearing premium names would be of , at least , mezzanine quality .
when i buy on the web and can not better scrutinize the items i 'm choosing , i tend to favor trusted brands .
as it turns out , these sheets did not have the calphalon name on them anywhere - calphalon apparently made the decision to buy up a bunch of cheap -made in china- cookie sheets and sell them at a premium price by leveraging the calphalon brand .
with the holiday baking season upon us , what do i plan to replace them with ?
the vollrath cookie sheets ( not non-stick , but i use silicone mats , so do i care ?
) recommended in cooks illustrated magazine .
they 're in stock at chef resource - their price everywhere is $ 19 but most vendors are out of them .
they 're due to arrive via ups day after tomorrow - tuesday , 10/17 .
holiday baking is much too sacred a tradition to be left in the hands of calphalon , apparently .
if i could give them no stars or provide an icon of 6 sheets going into the trash , i would so rate them .

you truly get what you pay for in this case .
we bought the red ones and they have left fuzzies all over the house .
in the dryer , you need to check the lint trap frequently , as they shed like mad .
they are not smooth and cozy , they have a very high coefficient of friction and it 's sorta hard to scootch around on them .
i would not recommend .

i thought it was a good deal to order a " factory-reconditioned " roomba 4210 discovery to save some money , however.. .
it arrived !
i excitedly opened the box .
first impression.. .
the unit was dirty , very heavily scatched and scuffed .
not exactly a good first impression .
i then lifted the roomba out of the box and i was immediately covered with dirt and dust .
the bottom of the box was also filled with dirt and dust and hair .
i flipped it over and discovered the brushes covered with dirt , dust and someones ( or somethings !
) hair .
i was grossed out , but even worse , the other person in the room ( who suffers from allergies ) started to sneeze violently .
i spent the next 20 minutes thoroughly vacuuming the entire room and all other horizontal surfaces i could reach .
i think it is very obvious that nobody did anything with this roomba since the previous owner returned it besides transfer the polystyrene packing box to a new cardboard box that says " remanufactured " on it !
in summary - be very careful ! ! !
if you ordered a " factory-reconditioned " , be aware that it might be pre-filled with someone elses dust , dirt , hair and who knows what else .
i think i might have to bite the bullet and pay full price .
i like the idea of this product , but not the pre-filled one i received

when it works , this blender does a fine job , and looks great .
however , our first one quit turning the blades in less than a year .
we sent it in , after many calls to customer service , and they kept the darned thing for 3 months before deciding to send us a replacement .
the replacement lasted only 2 years before the blades broke .
during that 2 years , we figured out that our extra set of blades did n't fit in bottom ring properly , and allowed fluid to pour through the motor .
great .
i should have save up to buy a vitamix instead

on 8/15/06 , i purchased and irobot roomba scheduler .
within one month of purchase , it failed completely and would not work at all .
on the irobot website , it claims that their customer service department is open 24/7 , and they guarantee a reply to an email within 24 hours .
i sent an email , and i never heard anything back from them at all .
after a week , i called their technical support line , and i waited on hold for 38 minutes before being able to speak to a technician , who swiftly determined that my unit was defective and needed to be replaced .
i was told to mail in my defective unit and that another one would be shipped to me .
it is now 11/9/2006 and i have received nothing and heard nothing from irobot .
do not purchase one of these units unless this kind of product unreliability and abysmal technical support is appealing to you .

at first i was pretty happy with the grater , but after a few days of use i started to notice that i was getting small shavings of metal as well as shredded cheese .
i am no longer using it and would not recomend it to anyone

</review_text>
<review_text>

well , i 'm not terribly impressed with this metal rotary grater .
yes , it will grate cheese , but the gap between the drum and compartment that holds the cheese is a little over 1/4 of an inch .
this allows for the cheese to get 'gummed ' up and eventually that large wad just falls through .
also , for harder cheeses this means you 're constanty picking out chunks of cheese that should have been grated .
i 've yet to find a rotary grater i 'm happy with .
i 've broken several plastic models within 2 days of owning them .
while i 've yet to break this metal model , it just does n't perfrom very well .
i 'm still using my stand-up grater

</review_text>
<review_text>

i bought this to replace my old mouli grater which finally bit the dust .
big mistake .
it is sturdy and reasonably well designed , but the grating surfaces barely work at all , or at least mine did n't .
to get it to grate cheese takes a long time and a lot of muscle , so much so that you are likely to start wondering how badly you really want the grated cheese .
i tried the grater drum on reasonably fresh parmesan and later tried the shredder drum on jarlsberg .
neither drum worked satisfactorily .
that may be because it is made in china where hard western-style cheese is nearly unknown .
yeah i know it says miu france but the box clearly says " made in china " .
i finally got so mad i threw it out in frustration

well , i just got my blender , real excited to use it , filled it up with the ingredients , flipped on the switch , and within 5 seconds it started smoking , badly , and then died .
i turned it off and tried to turn it on again , and all it did was make a grumbly noise .
so i am sending it back and sticking with my old hamilton that i have had for 9 years .
why did i quit using it in the first place .
$ 20 blender and it made a perfect smoothie .
$ 79 for this waring and it crashed and burned on me .
my advice is it looks nice , but it is n't worth the money , especially since it died right away on me .
oh well.. .

when i bought this item i attempted to test it in hot water .
my only comparison was another grocery store thermometer which was n't accurate .
it appeared to register better than the grocery store model .
however , when using it to make chocolate fudge , by the time it registered 225 degree 's , the fudge was thickening in the pan , not a pretty sight .
i used it correctly and it has been stored according to manufacturers direction .
it has a 5 year limited warranty for replacement .
i do n't feel it 's worth the trouble to send back as i do n't want another of this brands products , ever .
it 's going in the garbage as i attempt to find an accurate , well calibrated candy thermometer

discount any review of a blender that reflects only several months of use .
as a smoothie addict , shoveling a dozen or more ice cubes into the jar daily , i 'm still looking for a machine that can go the distance ( is a full year 's use asking too much ? ) .
the braun burned out in the first 90 days , faster than my black and decker , oster , even hamilton beach ( though it lasted longer than back to the basics ) .
the best thing i can say for the braun is that it does n't have the impossible-to-clean push buttons ( always look for a single switch , a knob , or a touch-pad ) .
otherwise , their shavers have served me better , mowing down whiskers more dependably than ice cubes .
i 'm going back to the beginning and giving the classic single-switch oster another try , though i 'm beginning to feel guilty about cluttering the landfills with more broken machinery and useless glass jars

i use a blender to do two things : 1 ) make smoothies ; and 2 ) stir batter for crepes .
this device apprently can not handle frozen fruit .
the white , plastic " teeth " on the bottom of the blades , that mesh / connect to the motor 's " teeth , " immediately started breaking .
three smoothies later only one plastic tooth remains and it is starting to fracture .
( my smoothies were made of yogurt , o.j. , some frozen mango... nothing extreme .
)

as far as the crepes go , even with only one " tooth " remaining , this baby still can stir eggs , milk , and a little flour ( thank you for small miracles ) .
but... the glass jug is a dribbler .
when you pour batter or smoothies or whatever , some of the liquid will always ( i mean always ) dribble off the glass jug 's lip , down the front of the jug , down the front of the control panel , and also into the recessed area where those " teeth " meet each other .
so... you have to clean all the blender each time you use it ( i.e. , the jug , the control panel , the recessed area in which the jug sets ) not just clean the jug .
what a pain in the neck .
once the last tooth breaks , this baby is going in the garbage .

this citrus juicer has a very good external design .
the problem is that 30w is not enough power for doing the job well : normal orange presure stops de motor !
the transmission of the power is done by cheap plasic parts , so they broke easily .
these parts broke after a dozen of uses in my case , so i do not recommend this machine .

ok...so this isnt a review,but a question i have on this product .
where is the instruction manual to this thing ?
what do the lines above the alcohol names mean .
there are two , three , even four lines above some of the alcohol names .
does it mean the amount of alcohol that is supposed to be put into that particular drink .
please answer...for it has left many of us flustered .

while seeing this pasta bowl on sale for $ 4.99 here at amazon.com , i did n't think twice to purchase several of them will all kind of color availalbe 2 weeks ago .
what a great price !
i was so excited and waiting on the door on the schedule delivery day .
the packing is nice and secure .
the color was so vivid at the first sight , but.... after i took a hard look , almost half of the bowls are defective ! !
un-colored white spot , un-glazed bubble holes , black dots/stain inside of the bowl .
even defective spots are tiny , but they are so obvious .
they just do n't look good with those flaws on them !
i was so....disappointed and frustrated as i went through all the 21 bowls i ordered .
by the way , the black bowl have no name or mark of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowl .
i will say those are probably the factory-secondary products .
it turned out i have to return almost half of the bowls and keep those bowls with bearable defectiveness , such as vague stamp of the manufacturer on the bottom of the bowls .
of course , all the black ones are returned since they are no-name with the bad quality .
no one will even believe they are fiestaware !

tired of exploring every possible way to ruin a pot of rice , i was looking forward to something that would do the job well and consistently .
no such luck with this one !
first , it uses a different measuring system for the rice ( " rice cooker cup " ) than it does for the water ( " regular measuring cup " ) , so if you need more or less than the few amounts they list it 's back to guesswork again !
worse though , is that the amount of water they call for is hugely more than is actually needed , so it boils very fast while pumping out all the excess water as steam .
for those who might like to take a steam bath while they cook this would be great .
one might figure out how to adjust the measuring , but there seems no way to slow the boiling down to lessen the steam output .
since water boils at the same temperature , fast or slow , it makes no sense .
yet another gripe is that it automatically goes into " warm " mode when it is finished .
may be handy to have the warm option , but if you do n't realize it 's done and its left on " warm " for ten minutes the rice turns into a solid slab .
it seems very well made , and handsome bau-haus design , but unfotrtunately i ca n't use it because of the above problems .
others ' experience may vary .
keep in mind i 'm very good at ruining rice .
i just do n't need help doing it !

i hardly ever write reviews but i felt the need to on this item .
i bought the senseo deluxe last night , i wanted the deluxe model so that i could also make tea .
the setup was quick and easy and the price was great compared to the competition .
here 's the problem , i brewed a cup of coffee and this was the weakest coffee ever and i 'm not even a big coffee drinker .
to make matters worse each pod only makes 4oz of coffee .
who drinks only 4 ounces of anything .
you would need to use 2 pods just to make 8 oz and then the coffee is still weak .
which is wear the waste of money comes in .
the senseo pods are the same price as the home cafe pods but you will go through them twice as fast .
i personally ended up returning this machine and getting a tassimo this morning .
i originally bought the senseo because i didnt want to spend tassimo money but in the end you pay for what you get .
now the tassimo is great .
i 've made hot chocolate for my daughter and tea for my son .
everyone likes it .
good luck everyone .

this was an excellent item...for about 3 uses...then the mandoline would not hold to one thickness...it keeps opening up to maximum cut depth .

it 's too bad .. .
i really wanted this to work , since i love soft serve .
but after using it twice i donated to goodwill .
it would be great if somebody brought out a home version of the " drill " thing they use in some frozen yogurt places .
until then the best bet is to let the ice cream or frozen yogurt thaw in the fridge for a few hours , then stir it up with a spoon until it 's the preferred level of softness

the black & decker ic200 arctic twister ice cream mixer is a product that you must not purchase .
it is a total waste of money .
it 's designed to make soft-serve ice cream at home .
the are not enpough pro 's and way too many cons .
the only pro : it makes soft-serve ice cream when ever you want .
cons
1 .
it 's loud and noisy
2 .
the ice cream you use in it must be as frozen as it is the second it comes out of the freezer which makes it very hard to scoop out .
3 .
if not used correctly , it make a huge mess .
4 .
it wastes ice cream .
when you use this product , half of the ice cream gets stuck inside the machine .
5. by the time its finished , ice cream is pratically melted .
6 .
you ongly get about 1/3 of what you put in the machine .
the rest gets stuck inside the machine .
7 .
you have to hold onto the on switch while operating the machine .
8 .
you have to hand pump the ice cream into soft-serve yourself .
this black & decker ic200 arctic twister ice cream mixer is such a waste of money .
i so reccomend not buying this .
just going to dairy queen or baskin robins is a much easier and cleaner solutio

i had a black and decker processor that i got as a wedding present over twenty years ago , and it never let me down once .
when it was time to get a new one , i got this 1500 thinking that it 's a b&d and i ca n't go wrong .
well as as soon as i tried to grate some cheese the plastic ring on the shredder/grater blade snapped off .
the next time i used it a metal pin in the pastic cover that holds the blade securely broke the plastic groove it was in .
too bad b&d went down the drain through the years

i received my food processor for christmas .
i had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding .
i decided to see if i could buy accessories for mine online .
i could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the power pro ii .
i was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews i came across during my search .
despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out , i decided to keep it .
i used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working !
i strongly recommend not purchasing this food processor

</review_text>
<review_text>

i read the reviews after i purchased it .
we made grated cheese ( turned out so so ) and * tried * to make hummus but it would n't even turn the blade and was very , very noisy .
i 'm returning it to target tomorrow .
if it ca n't stand up to crushing a few cooked beans then it 's no good to me .
until i find a better one i 'm using my 10 speed osterizer blender i 've had for 10 years .
it made hummus easily

smoke started pouring out the back .

if i could give this thing a negative number , i would .
i just threw away 2 large bags of brown sugar because , after i had thrown away the bags the sugar came in , i could not get the z845 to work .
what a mess !
i had brown sugar all over that part of my kitchen .
on a couple of occasions the sealer has worked without creating a vacuum .
this time it appeared to be trying unsuccessfully to pull all the air out of the bag , but the bag never sealed .
i have watched the video several times and have read and re-read the instructions .
at first i thought i was not operating it correctly , but now i believe the foodsaver is the problem .
the first time i used it , to seal a quantity of chicken for the freezer , it worked beautifully .
it has n't worked right since then .
another problem is that it wastes an amazing amount of plastic material .
is it possible this thing was invented for the purpose of selling refills , rather than to work as a sealer

these dishes , first of all , are just beautiful .
the white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous .
that said , be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them .
they break horribly easily and the cleanup , well , we just wo n't go there .
i 've had mine for 10 years and now i 'm down to just two of the serving pieces .
they break very easily in the oven , in the cabinet , you name it , it 's gone .
if you 're looking for a better one , go for the le creuset la poterie line , or just grab a longaberger one .
they 're definitely worth it because you 'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece .
i hate trying to clean these after using them so i just do n't use them anymore for anything but to mix items .
that way , nothing gets baked on them and i am not breaking nails scouring off the mess .
i definitely recommend getting something else

we registered for this as a wedding gift and were disappointed to find the large dish shattered in both the first and second box we picked up .
it 's a very attractive set ; too bad it ca n't actually contain food due to broken corners , ca n't be washed in a dishwasher , ca n't be used on the stove , and ca n't be used to broil !
you ca n't use the ramikin dishes for creme brulee , which is why i wanted them .
additionally , target does n't allow you to open the box in the store to check the merchandise .
i realize most of the other reviews complain about the shattering too , but i just thought i 'd point out that the corningware does n't have to be shipped to you to arrive broken

the blender part that holds the blade broke the second time i used it to crush ice .
the food processor part works ok , but the major problem is it 's extremely loud .

it 's louder than my circular saw

i picked this up recently and tried several varieties of loose tea in it .
the bottom line is that tea does get stuck in the one that i own .
i have tried a couple of methods to get the tea out to no avail .
it might be hard to see from the picture , but the " holes " for the water are actually slits in the bottom around the bottom rim of the infuser .
the slits are actually sickle shaped and the tea gets caught in the narrow areas .
i imaging that differences in the cuts would either make or break this product .
in my case they make me want to break it

i had the unit for about 4 weeks before it broke completely .
the rake would continually get clogged from the clumping litter , even with daily cleaning .
sometimes the unit would cycle on and off all night , very noisily , until i put a timer on it to turn off at night .
it was very diffult to clean , even with daily inspection .
go the old fashioned way , with a tray and a liner

great idea , horrible execution .
disgusting to clean , rake gets clogged .
there are much better options .
litter robot is well worth the extra cost

<review_text>

at first it looked like it was going to work great ( when the litter was clean ) .
after a day or so , it was n't cleaning very well .
i got better litter and it started working better , but still not great .
litter gets in the crevices and gets stuck to the rake .
after about two weeks of use , the rake stopped moving backwards .
i tried to fix it , but it just wo n't go in reverse .
overall , this was a big waste of time and money .
i 'm not even going to try to get another one .
a good old fashioned litter box with good clumping litter is less work than trying to get this thing to work properly while keeping it clean .
it 's too bad as it had a promising beginning .
do not buy

i loved this bread machine , but it broke after owning it for about three years .
my husband took it apart to try to fix it , but could not repair it .
it was making bread and just turned off .
we could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem .
we now have to replace it .
it worked great until it just stopped working .
i think a breadmaker should last longer then three years .
also , i did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough , so i could n't just program it and leave the house

the information on the pages that pertain to this hose needs to be changed to reflect the fact that the hose does not fit hoovers with a hepa system .
it only fits hoovers with product # 's beginning u53.. , u54.. , u64. .
i ordered it along with a new windtunnel that has a hepa system , since the product information stated that these 2 items were bought together by other people .
unfortunately , it does not state that these people ( now including me ) have to return the hose because it does not fit all windtunnels .
so be sure to check and doublecheck before you buy .
. .

upon opening the box i found that the information given in the buying information for this product did not reflect the actural product .
for one thing it only fits unright windtunnel models that use bags .
this hose is for models beginning with u53 , u54 and u64 only

i use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco .
you need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to , wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half .
adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice .
it looks ok , but it just is n't the quality item you would expect with the name cuisinart .
the price is also reasonable , so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that do n't require as much water or cook time ( like white rice )

bought one recently from a mervyns sale .
rice burned especially at the bottom ( black & crunchy ) .
so i returned and got another one in case the 1st one was defective .
nope , did the same thing .
so next go around , i added more water , but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice did n't burn as much this time .
for the cost and design , i was hoping this would be a great rice cooker .
design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord , however , this cooker ca n't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it .
yes , i did add enough water and followed instructions and used the measuring cup .
hopefully they 'll improve it .
better yet , maybe krups can design a better abd sleek-looking yet working rice cooker

i bought this in october , 2004 because i wanted something small for my kitchen .
you can not cook over 2 cups of rice without it spurting out all over the cooker .
now , it shuts off mid-way and i have to wait for it to cool down and try to reset it .
hopefully the " powers that be " will read these comments and make improvements

i had a hard time with this product .
the item does not cut the dough well and the ravioli kept opening as a result of this .
in my opinion , i like the size of a 12 count ravioli maker better .
this 10 count makes ravioli thats too large

i have many fond childhood memories of making and decorating sprtiz cookies with my mother .
she had an old copper and stainless steel cookie press and it turned out perfect cookies almost everytime .
when i found the kitchenaid cookie press on clearance for a mere $ 4.97 at my local sears , i snatched it up with high hopes of recreating those fond childhood memories in the kitchen .
it 's not a bad cookie press , but it 's definitely not the best out there , i 'm sure...and it does n't stack up at all to my mother 's old-fashioned one .
as stated in another review , many discs do n't seem to work at all well with this press .
i tried the tree , candy cane , and star discs and every single one just squirted out an uneven messy blob .
somehow the press pushed out the dough unevenly out of the press , so that one side of the shape was a blob while the other side was barely out of the press .
the rosette , swirl , and ribbon shapes did fairly well , though they turned out much larger shapes than the older model i 'm used to...hence extending the baking time of the cookies .
i 'm used to nice , thin , crispy ribbons , but this press turned out very thick ones .
i was also not very fond of the ratcheting style of the press .
it felt as though i had less control over it than the squeeze-gun type .
if i 'd paid full price for this press , i would have been a bit upset at the quality , but having paid only $ 5 for it , i 'm just disappointed because i had thought kitchenaid to be a better quality brand than what i 've seen in this cookie pres

i am a major fan of " le creuset " pots and have a number of them but i must say that their kettle is not up to par .
like the other lady said , it does spit out water ( substantially at that ) when it boils on the stove .
i am finally throwing mine out to the garbage since i have had it for a while and the coating at the inside bottom of the kettle is coming apart and i have been boiling " contaminated " water since a while...i just noticed one day that there was this stuff floating on top of the water....i wonder what kind of chemicals i have been putting in my body ? ?

i have probably seen hundreds of tea kettles by now and still love the look of this one the best .
only problem is that they rust ! ! !
i had mine a few weeks when i noticed the rust spots on the interior .
i do n't imagine the enamel could have been chipped on the inside of the pot , so it must have happened simply because i leave water in my tea kettle at all times .
the directions that come with this kettle say not to do so , but any serious tea drinker like me knows that 's unrealistic .
i threw mine out and am very disapointed that something that cost so much money did n't last long at all .
i thought le creuset was supposed to be really high quality but i 'm officially disillusioned thanks to this tea pot

in theory , this is a good machine .
it did , in fact , work as advertised for a brief time - then it started to smell .
all of the urine , drinks , vomit , whatever nasty stuff you just vaccumed up from your carpet , starts to pool under the holding tank .
as it festers there , the exhaust fan takes that wonderful aroma and blows it all over your house .
this , to an extent , is simply a nuisance - bad smell and extra clean-up of the machine itself - until it starts leaking all of that crap back into your carpet , making more mess than you started with .
the first time this happened , bissell customer service sent a replacement unit .
we started having the same problems with it shortly after we received it .
bissell only wants to send us another ( no doubt defective ) unit - so unless you want to be stuck with a stinky , urine-leaking , mess-maker , do n't buy this product !

we purchased the cuisinart smartpower blender for smoothies and light duty blending duties .
it 's a nicely designed unit , very stable on the countertop , but very poor quality gear drive .
after a couple dozen uses , the motor gear wheel broke , apparently a common problem on these cuisinarts , as noted by other reviewers .
cuisinart customer service is worthless - it costs more to ship and repair the unit than to replace it .
replaced the worthless cuisinart with a kitchenaid .
would recommend avoiding cuisinart blenders due to this gear design flaw

airbake products are horrible !
i have used the cookie sheets multiple times and i have had nothing but problems .
there products over-brown everything you cook and the food sticks no matter how well you grease the pans .
i have better luck using my old cheap non-stick bakeware than airbake .
buyer beware !
if you do choose to buy this brand of products grease the pans generously and cut the bake time and oven temperature

i used this press about 4-5 times during the 5 years i owned it .
the cookie shapes came out well , but after a few uses , the plastic ring around the barrel cracked .

this item is metal and looks like an old fashioned ice crusher , but it is so small that it is useless .
its only 9 inches tall , so if you are expecting a nice big heavy duty machine , forget it .
i bought it because i missed the ice in the door of my old fridge , but after trying it several times , i sent it back .
it is so small that you rap your knuckles on the counter .
i dont think there is a glass made that is small enough to fit in it , so you have to use the little tin cup that comes with it .
i takes about three loads of ice to fill the cup , and about 2 cups to fill a glass .
you need 4 hands to operate it : 1 to hold the lid , 1to turn the crank,1to keep it from bouncing all over the place , and 1 to hold the little tin cup in place ( it slides out and then the ice lands on the base ) .
then when you finally get a cup fulll of ice , you have to try to get it out of the tin cup and into your glass .
i broke the glass the first time i tried it .
it hass little rubber feet that fall out and disapear , making it even more wobbly .
but as i said in the begging , it is cute

the furniture itself is fine .
or rather , it would be if it was shipped properly .
before ordering anything from target , think long and hard about how willing you are to deal with damaged goods and their return .
if you receive something damaged ( and you will ) , be prepared for an extensive return process .
chances are , the item they send you as a replacement will be damaged as well .
this happened to me twice .
if you 're lucky , you will be able to piece something decent together from the multiple shipments .
this , however , will take time .
additionally , even if the piece is not cracked , you will need to make a trip to the hardware store to purchase stain to fix the discolorations in the wood .
i bought the desk , the hutch and the bookcase - all of which had to be returned to replace cracked pieces and all of which had to be touched up with stain .
also be advised that target does not make it clear that certain pieces will not be delivered at all if you do not make arrangements with the outside carrier .
after waiting and waiting , and calling target on several occasions , someone will eventually relay the information that you need to call the carrier and make a delivery appointment - even though other pieces arrived without such complications .
quite honestly , this has been far more inconvenient than it was worth .
by the time you pay for the shipping and the tax , this is not so much a " deal " but a waste of time and money .

this blender is frustrating .
it offers good points , but in the end , the flaws outweigh the benefits .
first the good :

the heavy glass base is stable and easy to clean .
the powerful motor hacks through most foods with ease .
when the blender is started , the motor begins at a low speed for a second or two before turning on fully .
the problems i found led me to toss the blender .
if you plan on making blended soups , beware of the explosive force with which this beast turns on .
without a heavy hand on the lid , both the lid and your soup will hit the ceiling .
moderately thick , viscous liquids ( a lemon cream was the latest such one i experienced ) tend to get caught in the scalloped swoops in the jar .
this leads to only the center portion of the liquid being actively blended , while the outer edges stagnate and remain clumpy .
deft work with a spatula is required to coax everything into the blending area .
the above problems were annoying , caused occasional swearing , but were tolerable .
what finally got me shopping for a replacement was worse .
after several years of moderate use , the kitchenaid stopped working .
the blades and motor are connected via a set of rubber teeth .
these reduce operating noise , but over time , weaken .
the problem first arose when making smoothies with chunky frozen fruit such as strawberries .
a burning rubber smell came from the blender coupled with a strange noise and no action in the container .
the rubber drive teeth slipped , and friction quickly heated them up .
the result was hot , floppy rubber teeth that bent flat instead of turning the blades .
when this happens , it takes 20 minutes or more before the teeth are capable of another round of use .
before long the blender could not even swirl water for more than a few seconds before the teeth slipped

i purchased the robinson pyrex candy thermometer as a replacement for my old , cheap tube thermometer that was giving off readings .
my experience was that the probe failed to register temperatures above 100 degrees celcius .
it would get there and just freeze .
additionally , the design of the thermometer makes it difficult to read exactly where your temperature is .
this makes it unsuitable for most candy-making where the difference of a degree or so could be critical .
the physical design of the thermometer feels very sturdy and is a nice stainless .
it is rather deceptive since you think you may be purchasing a higher quality tool than you are actually buying .
all said and done , after you replace the sugar , flavorings , creams and other ingredients from your spoiled batches of candy...and pay for the gas to run these errands ...the cost of using robinson 's pyrex candy thermometer goes way up .
use a cup of ice water .
or a more reliable brand of candy thermometer .
it 's much better to shell out the extra dollars and get beautiful consistent results

</review_text>
<review_text>

the only positive thing i can say about this candy thermometer is that the design allows it to stay on the sauce pan relatively well .
other than that , it is difficult to discern temperatures between the 0 - 50 marks .
also , it tends to read low so that the candy is much warmer than the read out indicates .
since using this thermometer , i have ruined more batches of fudge than i care to think about .
if you want a good candy thermometer , do n't buy this one .

to begin with. .
this pan heats up even and fast .
i have a hard anodized circulon non-stick pot , a copper bottom skillet , and this calphalon pan .
the heat distribution is excellent , and unlike the copper bottom pan , the calphalon is light and easy to use .
but , the good stops here .
the stick problem is bad , and my stainless steel copper bottom pan sticks less than this calphalon skillet .
since it 's not a non-stick pan , some sticking is expected , but clean up is just pain .
regular soaking over nite will not help sometimes .
if u cook vegitable and small amount of meat , this pan is good .
but never fry egg or cook steak in this pan .
avoid anything that will carmalize or contain high sugar .
i once cooked some balsamic vinegar mushroom with brown sugar in this pan , and it took me forever to get it clean again since the sugar carmalization litterally stuck to the bottom .

i have always used rubbermaid or tupperware plastic storage , but i replaced all of them with pyrex glass storage containers in may of 2005 .
i was worried that the plastic storage was seeping toxins into my food when i washed it in the dishwasher .
also , i liked the idea that glass does not stain and it gives a clear presentation of stored food in the refrigerator--making leftovers more likely to be eaten before they go bad .
unfortunately , i have not been happy with this product .
the pyrex lids must be pried off with a great deal of strength and diligence .
this is not a task for a child , or even a standard adult .
i have had to ask my husband on more than one occasion to take a lid off for me .
i have even spilled food in attempts to take lids off .
as an aside , i have also found that the pyrex glass is heavy , which makes it less desirable to carry leftovers to work and the containers do not " nest , " so they take up more space than they need to in the cabinet .
i recommend bormioli glass storage containers instead .
they are lighter in weight , they nest , and the lids come off with the strength of a normal person .

this sushi set is really nice .
unfortunately amazon does n't know how to ship ceramic properly .
in my original order , they sent it in a medium-sized box , with air cushions only on one side .
of course several of the pieces were shattered .
so i requested a replacement via the returns website .
the second order was dispatched immediately and sent via next-day .
that was impressive .
what was not impressive was that this time it was sent in an even * smaller * box , packed so tightly that the air cushions had burst .
naturally this set was also shattered .
fortunately , i had n't yet returned the first order , so i was able to cannibalize some good pieces from the first set to complete the second .
i 'm sure their returns department wo n't like hearing that , but as i see it i 've saved them the cost of a refund .
needless to say i wo n't be ordering ceramic flatware from amazon again .
once again , i like the style of the set itself , and think it 's a great deal for the price .
i just recommend that you buy it somewhere else .

well im the newest victim of exploding pyrex .
last night i was cooking some salmon in my 3-quart pyrex that i 've had for 3 years and used many times before .
it was in my oven at 400 for only 25 minutes .
i pulled it out and set it on the counter .
well i leaned in to check the salmon and as i pulled away the glass exploded !
not just broke but a full on explosion of glass flying everywhere .
thankfully i pulled away when i did because if i had pulled away 2 seconds later i would have had a face full of pyrex shrapnel .
i came away with only a few small cuts on my stomach...and from what i 've heard i was lucky .
even though my boyfriend and i swept and vacumed our kitchen last night there was so much glass that in the morning light i could still see little pieces of glass all over the kitchen .
im not taking any chances , im throwing out my other pyrex dishes and switching to all aluminum trays .
please do not use pyrex !
it is not worth the risk !
you may have a few years of good use , but is it worth risking your safety or that of your children ?
edit- i would just like to comment that i was using the dish within the guidelines .
the oven was 400 and the dish was only in there for 25 minutes .
the kitchen was rather warm and the surface i set it on was not hot but definately not cool...so there was no drastic temperature change .
there were no scratches or cuts any where on the tray so i do not feel that the explosion was in anyway my fault .
this explosion was purely the result of a poorly manufactured item

i was given this coffee maker for a birthday gift a couple of years ago and after i figured out how to make it work , loved it .
after a while the latch on the top broke off and i had to hold the top down while it was grinding the coffee .
that made the timer on it useless unless you propped something against it to hold the top down .
it was a little inconvenient but i got use to it .
then the metal filter broke and i decided to get a new one .
luckily i put the old one in the garage for " spare parts " because not long after i started using the new one the side tab broke off and i had to grab a replacement off the old one .
i will probably not purchase this brand again

i owned a rival crockpot for 20 years and was very happy with it .
when it stopped working i therefore bought another ( this one ) from rival .
i 've used it twice .

i bought this because it was well priced , good sized and looked better than many other slow cookers .
i assumed it would work as well as my 10 year old slow cooker that i gave away .
the first time i used it ( as soon as it got up to tempurature ) the lid started to rumble and slip around the top .
then came the spitting hot water and steam that went in my toaster down the side of the cooker and on the counter .
the lid is the worst !
at first i thought maybe i was missing a rubber seal or something on my lid .
now i realize this is the way it was designed !
i made a pork roast in it which usually works great but in this slow cooker it seemed to cook quicker with no liquid left because it evaporated through the faulty lid .
the only way to correct the spitting water and the rumbly,tumbly,bouncy lid is to put a paper towel under part of the lid but even this eventually fails because the towel gets soaked and then starts to drip on the counter .
not to mention its probably a fire hazard .
i do n't think my paper towel idea is what rival had in mind when they designed this !
i wish i could return this but i threw away the receipt .

i have had this for 2years now and what a waste of money it has been .
i have used this a few of times before i decided to toss them .
this set was a disaster .
the parer is dull period and the peeler peels off much more than just the skin , you lose almost 20 % ( no exaggeration ) of the fruit or the vegetable

we have had this machine for about a year and it might have work right the first time we used it .
we now have to borrow a friends hoover steamvac when we need to clean the carpet .
we are getting ready to buy a different machine bcause this one would never work right .
it never has any suction power and it constantly sprays soap everywhere even if you have it only on the water selection .
i would n't buy

i really thought i would like this product when i got it out of the box .
it 's looks well made and looked easy to use .
i followed instructions and cleaned it throughly and put my recipe misture and miniture sausages in it to slowly heat and to use as an appetizer .
i put the the heat setting on warm as i was not in a hurry and i left the room for about 5 minutes .
when i came back there was mixture all over my cabinets , counters , etc .
and what was left was boiling and sputtering like mad .
i later found out that no matter what heat setting i used it would over heat .
i can not recommend this product to anyone i 'm sorry to say

i 've had to bring this back to hoover 5 times in less than a year .
the belt for the self-propelled motor comes off ever other time i use the vacuum .
the on/off button has been fixed 3 times .
it works when it wants to .
even the guy at the hoover store admitted that this piece of garbage is known for problems with the belt coming off .
i have nothing good to say about this .
i 'm a huge consumer reports fan but they missed the boat on this one .
they need to update their testing over the long-term .
i 'm still pissed i blew $ 250 on this ridiculous excuse for a vacuum

like many others , i bought this because it came highly recommended by consumer reports .
it worked great for a while , but after about a year the brush stopped spinning .
i replaced the belt ( twice !
) but it still wo n't work .
if i did n't read about so many others having similar problems , i would have guessed that i just got a bad vacuum - but after reading other reviews here at amazon , i see that this is not a model that anyone should buy , despite the high rating from consumer reports

the tea press works fine if you are planning on serving a crowd .
for one or two people , it simply does n't work .
you must add an enormous amount of tea for the press to work properly .
i once had a smaller tea press , and i thought that was what i was purchasing here .

i have other oxo items that i like very much , but these stainless steel measuring cups are a big disappointment .
i also experienced the handle bending easily when packing in brown sugar .
they will be in my next yard sale

i really like oxo products .
i have a number of their utensils in my kitchen and i enjoy that they have nice big handles .
since i started getting gadgets for my kitchen i always wanted these measuring cups .
well i finally got them .
i was very excited to use them for the first time .
well i went to scoop some brown sugar and the handle started bending .
i was very disappointed in how flimsy the handles are .
i think i 'll stick to my plastic ones from oxo , i had better luck with them

</review_text>
<review_text>

usually oxo produces well designed items that have you thinking &quot ; they * really * thought about how this thing was going to be used ( and abused ) ! &quot ; unfortunately the other reviewers are spot on -- very bendy handles .
it 's a shame , but you should pass on these

i have been making ice cream in a cuisinart machine for years but i wanted to regain my freezer space from the 2 canisters i had to keep ready. .
i also wanted to make good gelato since i ca n't go to italy all the time .
i had first bought the lussino 4080 by musso .
it was terrible .
too soft right out of the machine and full of ice crystals when put in the freezer for any amount of time .
it did n't get firm , it became a rock .
i returned it and got the lello gelato pro instead .
it is quieter , has a washable bowl , costs about half the money , weighs much less and makes 2 quarts rather than 1&1/2 quarts .
there is no contest .
the lello is the superior machine

i bought this " piece of junk " at wal * mart .
i was actually surprised to see a food processor so cheap , so i decided to buy it .
after going home and washing the product , i decided to try it out .
i plugged it in and nothing .
it did n't even budge !
anyway , i am going to have to drive all the way back to wal * mart and return this.. .

save your money and go with a more expensive model that will last you. .

the old oxo tea kettles had a train whistle sound .
this new one has a single high pitch whistle that is so weak you could n't hear it in the next room .
save your money and buy something cheaper .
it will work as well if not better .
i returned mine and got another brand and it works just fine and it was cheaper too .

unlike the other reviewers , my kitchenaid cork screw worked fine for almost two years .
it never quite pulled the cork far enough out of the bottle to suit me -- it did n't make cork pulling labor-free -- but i found it much easier than any previous such tool i ever owned .
alas , as in many of the other reviews , the screw finally broke off in a cork and the device seems irreparable .
a cheap plastic cork screw had to be called into service .
i just visited the kitchenaid web page and they do n't offer a cork screw for sale anymore .
i presume that i will soon toss mine as well .
planning to buy one of these for $ 30 ?
clint would ask you : do you feel lucky

like 7 of the 8 other reviews , this product broke with no way to repair it .

i , too , bought this terrible piece of equipment .
my complaint , aside from the odd taste , consistency and smell , was that you could not tell when the egg was done .
it was still raw at 10 minutes .
by the time it was cooked you could have used it for a nerf ball .
what a waste of money .
as far as thinking up other purposes for it , i suppose it could be a sacrificial camping outdoor firepit cook pan for something .
you 'll have to think of something , just do n't put eggs in it

its just a simple plastic tube that fits on the end of the grinder attachment so you can stuff sausage .
so how did they manage to mess this one up ?
the flare at the wide end of the horn does not sit flat against the head of the grinder , so when you go to tighten the ring down to hold it into place , the collar can not screw on all the way .
the result ?
a build up of meat in the front part of the collar .
this eventually begins to drip down making a bloody mess of whatever is under the grinder attachment .
how hard would it have been for kitchenaid to design the horn so it fitted flat in place and the collar would have screwed on tight ?

to be fair , the design is great looking , size is ideal , and very functional .
however , beware of quality and packaging .
whoever packaged this in thailand did not take care , it has nicks and scratches everywhere..not to mention the dings in corners .
paint in all the panels is inconsistent..therefore , you can see different colorations throughout different panels .
it is somewhat redish in stain tone , could be darker to be a true dark walnut .
manufacturing flaws such as missing drill holes , which makes it tough when assembling...got screws , just missing screw holes .
i only recommend to those with a nack of wood handyman , not for the average person .
recommend you need the following tools : drill with phillips screw heads and drill bits ( just in case ) , small bottle of dark wood stain ( to touch up painting the scratches ) , and some patience .
to continue , beware when placing this table on a true flat surface , it may have uneven stance...ok on carpeting .
and beware if displaying in bright lit areas...people may see the different paint tones , and difference between the two table .
lasting , it is not 100 % solid wood , some panels have veneer over particle board .
heck , what do you expect for $ 69bucks. .

i was so excited to receive my delonghi caffe sorrento bar4 4-cup espresso/cappuccino machine .
being an experienced expresso drinker i started to brew my expresso , needless to say the frother works so so good you do not even have to turn it on .
water and steam everywhere , also the frother does not turn off , i tried so hard that the knob came off .
i was very dissapointed

my screwpull lever model broke after opening roughly 40 bottles over 1 + year .
locked up and when i pulled a little harder it stripped a gear ( the notches into which the gear meshes are only plastic .
)

i suspect the lockup during the twist-cork-in -then-lift-up cycle was due to worn part within the screw housing .
in any event , it 's unacceptable for something this expensive to fail with
such limited use .
at the very least , the gear mechanism should be stainless steel vice metal-plastic to provide better wear .
plus , we just talking about a stupid corkscrew .
how hard /costly would it be to build something decent vice a piece of overpriced yuppy crap ?
?

regardless of the setting you use , you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds .
in addition , the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work .
be prepared to grind more than you need , and then measure the grounds ( somehow avoiding the powder ) yourself .

in my case i ca n't even say it 's noisy because the grinder did n't work at all !
manufacturing defect deprived me the chance to listen how it works

</review_text>
<review_text>

i bought this thinking i would be able to regulate the size , ( i have had my other coffee grinder for 10 yr. still works ) , to say it is loud is an understatement , & 1st thing in the am .
i had it about 2 weeks , when i noticed it was hot to the touch , and it no longer worked , mind you i had not used it in 2 days , and had moved it to clean .
i have not contacted them at this point , but do not want a replacement , and a part of me is glad it broke , so i do n't have to listen to the noise anymore

i ordered the my cafe from amazon in early october and received it a few days later .
on initial set-up , the unit failed to prime .
i talked to bunn 's service dept .
and was coached to try several steps , which did not work .
i was given a return authorization number and told that i would be sent a brand new machine once they received the defective one .
i have fed ex verification that the my cafe was received by bunn on october 18 .
i called bunn on november 6 and was told that they would check on my replacement and call me back in a couple on minutes .
no return call came .
i called again on november 9th and was told that the my cafe has been on back order and that i am in line with an unknown other number of customers awaiting shipment .
they could not , or would not , give me any meaningful information on when i might expect to see if the replacement works any better than the original .
my cafe may be a great machine but bunn 's service is atrocious

i got the machine yesterday and was so excited .
i got it all ready to prime by following the directions , and it did n't work .
after several attempts i called bunn customer service thinking that i must be doing something wrong .
when i talked to the customer service rep. he told me that the machine was n't pumping hot water into the reservoir and that this was a common problem with the machine .
i 'm thinking for $ 200.00 this is n't right , and why has n't the company fixed it ?
he was very nonchalant about it as if it did n't matter ; just get a new one .
this just is n't acceptable to me .
there are many positive reviews so i 'm sure if you get a working one than you 'll probably be happy with it .
as for me , i refuse to use something that has a known problem that the company is n't even trying to remedy .
therefore , i 'm sending it back to amazon for a full refund and buying the simple human coffee maker which has gotten great reviews

the frother is great !
easy to use etc .
the espresso temperature is 140 degrees f when measuring the stream of coffee coming from the machine after the machine has warmed up for 6 minutes .
at that low temperature you ca n't extract the flavors and aroma required for a great cup of espresso .
other reviews stating it can take 5 minutes to brew a cup of espresso are accurate .
this occurs when the grind is too fine .
i 've had this machine for over a year and it is not recommended .
i use it mainly for the frother and make the espresso in another machine .
to add insult to injury , the chrome like decal on the machine has an air bubble under it so it looks cheap .
i thought it was chrome undil the decal started to get this bubble .
previously i had a gaggia which is superior in every manner , and cheaper also .
the only reason i rated it 2 stars is because of the frother .

i bought the capresso 114 last december ( the difference being , the model 112 has chrome trim and a very questionable milk reservoir ) .
this machine is unbelievably finicky ; you must use an extremely coarse grind ( according to the manual ) , and almost zero tamping pressure ( again , according to the manual ) , otherwise you get unbelievably slow coffee flow ( several minutes for a shot of espresso ) .
even when you get everything according to instructions ( which includes , according to capresso tech support , disassembling the machine every few days ) , it takes at least 5 minutes to pour a shot of espresso , which comes out weak , bitter , and with no crema .
after two months of discussing this with capresso tech support and getting nowhere , i returned the machine to amazon .
after that i bought a krups xp 4000 -- bliss !
the machine makes great espresso in about 25 seconds , even with a fine grind and firm tamp .

this machine is sure to disappoint a seasoned european-style coffee drinker ( coffee as in beverage made from coffee bean , not a tall cup of sanka as the term is used in the us ) .
admittedly , i 'm really picky about my coffee , but $ 250 for this machine is ridiculous .
i 've had coffee from a $ 40 krups machine that is better than that made by the espressopro .
i use high-quality pods with this machine ( molinari , lucaffe , and miscela d'oro ) which guarantees consistency in other machines , but does n't help with this machine .
here are my issues with the machine .
1 .
the thermoblock is n't effective .
i have to put water in my espresso cup and pop it in the microwave for 30 seconds before making an espresso or else my coffee will be lukewarm .
disgusting , even with high quality beans .
granted , unless your machine has a cup warmer , this is probably a good idea regardless of your machine , but with this machine , it is a requirement , not an option , if you want hot coffee .
second , steamed milk is lukewarm on a good day .
the same heating problem occurs with steaming milk .
i called capresso , and they said to check all the fittings .
in fact , after much frustration ( i 'm not an idiot ) , i finally just sealed the connections with shrink tube , which leaves only two points where the connection could be weak .
still , i ca n't get hot steam .
what i do get is either lukewarm liquid milk , or cool , overly thick foam .
in fact the foam is so unrefined and thick that it gives the impression that you could chew it .
nasty .
2 .
the frothing mechanism is gimmicky and not effective .
a standard " frothing wand " is much better .
the mechanism on this machine is ineffective , lacks true control , and requires an extra step over a standard wand to clean .
as explained above , the heat is not sufficient , and the quality of foam is irregular and bad .
i 'm embarrassed to serve coffee from this machine to guests , let alone drink it myself .
i just ca n't get over the heat issue .
nothing kills a good coffee than lack of heat .
this point is so important , if you take a gander at the francis !
francis !
x1 ( and professional machines ) , there 's a thermometer right on the front of the machine ( and no , it 's not purely an esthetic design issue since you can put several types of gauges/switches on an espresso machine--like a pressure gauge ) .
the low heat generated results in really thick , solid foam .
when i have guests , i just heat milk on the stovetop and use a handfrother instead of using the espressopro 's lame mechanism .
second , the way you adjust the foamed milk to steamed milk ratio is not effective .
a little gate is regulated by the user through a twisting tab .
it 's just not good design .
since the milk actually passes through the machine and is heated internally by the machine , you ca n't really " work " the milk .
a wand offers direct control and offers immediate visual response to whether you 're getting foam or hot milk .
you know dried milk that collects on your steaming wand ?
well , that 's now inside your espressopro .
with a traditional wand , you just wipe the wand with a wet rag .
with this machine , you need to run hot water through the frothing mechanism ( before you do this you need to wait for the block to heat up again ) .
plus , there 's so many little pieces that need to be kept clean , it 's a pain .
what a bad design !
3 .
18 bar ?
yeah , right .
this machine also does n't generate enough pressure to develop nice crema .
granted , i use pods , but still , a certain amount of crema is expected .
this machine produces a thin , insufficient amount of crema .
the lack of sufficient pressure probably has to do with the poor thermoblock .
i really ca n't recommend this machine .
for $ 250 , just go get a krups or braun .
better yet , spend $ 50 more and get an entry level gaggia or saeco .
with this machine you 're paying for looks and a gimmicky , ineffective frothing mechanism .
this hunk o ' junk is now buried deep in the back of my kitchen cabinet , as i truly would not feel right pawning this machine off on someone else .
it is now appropriately " retired " from service , and i now enjoy perfect coffee every day from my saeco vienna superautomatica .
now that 's a machine , baby

inside this unit there are 2 cleaning trays , one for the cleaning solution and the other for water to rinse .
each tray has a cup coming out the bottom which is used to lock the tray into the device .
after only 3 uses the base of the one cup cracked .
after about 6 more uses the other bottom cracked .
i would not recommend this product to anyone .

i too have experienced the water tank caving in and not working properly if you forget to take the water tank out of the steamer unit , and mind you , you must also remove the cap from the water reservoir even after you remove it from the steamer .
i have tried putting hot water in the tank in an attempt to regain its original shape to no avail .
i would not recommend buying this steamer for this reason

as another reviewer experienced , our krups also leaks coffee all over the counter and subsequently the floor quite often , which is apparently related to having to have the carafe situated in just exactly the right place within a half a millimeter , and which place i have not yet discovered except occasionally by chance .
carafe positioning appears to be the problem , because it does n't leak every time .
maybe my unit is defective , because other reviewers do n't mention this , and believe me , you would notice this if it were occurring with yours .
the opening to pour in water is relatively small , but i do n't have a huge problem with it .
be aware there is no automatic shut off .
it makes a fine cup of coffee for this non-coffee-gourmet , and i do n't have a problem with spilling when i pour from the carafe into a cup .
but the leaking is forcing me to find another machine .
i wish i could find a reasonably-priced , non-leaking 12-cup machine with removable water reservoir , no-drip carafe , programmable , auto shut-off , easy-to-find replacement carafe and removable filter basket but alas , even on amazon.com , that machine does not appear to exist .
my sister has such a machine ( mr. coffee urx23 ) , but that model has been discontinued .

</review_text>
<review_text>

i had slightly older edition of the krups crystal aroma for several years , until i lost one carafe too many - if you 're careless , when empty they tend to roll like a bowling ball right off the countertop .
but that 's my fault .
the crystal aroma carafe looks cool and the filter would probably help if you have unpleasant tap water , but overall , the quality of the coffee it produces is merely ok .
the reason not to buy this coffeemaker is that krups now makes a much better one .
" aroma control " is a poor description for the recent line of krups coffeemakers by that name actually do .
the aroma control machines have a simple , but ingenious mechanism for retaining the coffee in the brewing chamber for an extra minute before letting it drip through into the carafe .
more than filters or an exotic shape that supposedly retains aromas , that extra minute of brewing makes all the difference in the world .
unless you 're just in love with that round carafe , skip the " crystal aroma " and move on to the " aroma control " line .

i ordered the pro 5 plus three times and recieved the wrong one 3 times .
they kept sending the " commercial 5 mixer .
" in the meantime i have accumulated 2 shoping bags full of baking goods .
i have ordered many " cookie " art books , along with many supplies as well as the set of 3 pasta maker attachment for this mixer .
this has been going on since the beginning of december .
but no mixer !
calls end up in whatever country .
all they do is placate you with polite rhetoric and pat answers .
which is their job .
but this does not address the major problem .
the problem is never kicked up to a higher level , researched , investigated and thus ending in a resolution .
now i see this model or its equivalent , in costo .
very cheap but with the steel attachments ( whip , dough hook etc ) like the commerical one .
it looks like a combination of the pro 5 plus and the commercial one .
and the model no .
is not listed in kitchenade 's website .
there seems to be something amiss with this pro 5 plus model .
this has been a frustrating experience .
i now plan to order the pro 6 instead , which cook 's illustrated listed as number one .
and it wo n't be from amazon .
receiving the wrong one three times is a bit much .
dissapointed in the service .
